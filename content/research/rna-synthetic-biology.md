title: RNA synthetic biology
weight: 1
summary: We pioneered transcription-independent genetic control in mammalian
  cells, developing RNA-only logic circuits using RNA-binding proteins,
  miRNA-tuned elements, and self-amplifying RNA replicons that function in vivo
  without genomic integration. These advances—from model-driven replicon design
  and CRISPR- or small-molecule-regulated RNA circuits to clinically validated
  saRNA therapies—culminated in programmable RNA medicines such as STX-001,
  which has shown favorable safety and antitumor activity in Phase I trials.
