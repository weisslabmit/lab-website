title: RNA synthetic biology
weight: 1
summary: "The Weiss lab pioneered fully transcription‑independent genetic
  control layers for mammalian cells—building RNA‑only logic using RNA‑binding
  protein repressors and miRNA‑tuned elements, then encoding whole circuits on
  self‑amplifying RNA replicons that function in vivo, thereby avoiding genomic
  integration risks while retaining sophisticated programmability. Our research
  efforts advanced from model‑driven RNA replicon design (Beal 2014) and
  in‑vitro evolution of enhanced replicons for immunotherapy (Li 2019), to
  small‑molecule and CRISPR endoRNase–based control of RNA‑delivered circuits
  (Nat Chem Biol 2018; bioRxiv 2019), and in‑vivo validation of reversible
  switches that regulate saRNA (Mol Ther 2020). Complementary delivery
  breakthroughs—such as CAP‑lipid nanoparticles for saRNA and replicon‑encoded
  IL‑12 that eliminates established tumors and primes systemic immunity—helped
  translate laboratory research to a clinical setting (Li 2020). Most recently,
  with the Irvine lab, we demonstrated drug‑responsive non‑structural proteins
  that tune saRNA expression dynamics in vivo, underscoring therapeutic control
  at clinical timescales (Yousefpour 2025). This body of work seeded Strand
  Therapeutics, a startup co‑founded out of my lab with Irvine as a co-founder,
  to translate programmable saRNA medicines to patients. Strand’s lead candidate
  STX‑001, LNP‑encapsulated self‑replicating mRNA encoding IL‑12, based on (Li
  2020) reported Phase I data showing favorable safety results and significant
  antitumor activity including multiple RECIST responses with signs of
  regression in non‑injected lesions, providing early clinical validation of our
  RNA synthetic biology platform. "
