bio: "Hi, I'm Alex Tran . I'm an MIT EECS undergrad turned synthetic biology
  enthusiast. I'm exploring genetic and neuromorphic circuits as a way to
  combine my background in EECS with biology. The possibilities of what you
  could do with a biocomputer really excites me. Even though we are still far
  away from a fully functional biocomputer, it’s an incredible moment to be in
  synthetic biology as the field is advancing at a remarkable pace.

  When I’m not doing science, you’ll find me on the soccer pitch or on a bike,
  cooking very experimental recipes for friends, singing karaoke, and working on
  design projects. In the past, it's been a lot of graphic design/data viz and
  sculpture, but lately I've been diving into bioart (especially fluorescent E.
  coli). I love meeting people and I'm passionate about teaching and mentoring.
  Whether it’s a movie, a show, a song, or a play, I always love a good story
  and I have a soft spot for instant ramen, matcha, and acai bowls.\n"
