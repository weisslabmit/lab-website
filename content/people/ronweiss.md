  Prof. Weiss is one of

  the pioneers of synthetic biology. He has been engaged in synthetic biology

  research since 1996 when he was a graduate student at MIT and where he helped

  set up a wetlab in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department. After

  completion of his PhD, Weiss joined the faculty at Princeton University, and

  returned to MIT in 2009 to take on a faculty position in the Department of

  Biological Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering and

  Computer Science. Upon arrival to MIT, Weiss created and continues to serve as

  the Director of the MIT Synthetic Biology Center. The research pursued by Weiss

  over the years has placed him in a position of leadership in the field, as

  evidenced both by publications from his lab as well as a variety of awards and

  other forms of recognition. He pursues several aspects of synthetic biology, including

  design and synthesis of gene networks engineered to perform *in vivo* analog, digital logic, and

  neuromorphic computation. The Weiss lab published seminal papers in synthetic

  biology focused on programming cell aggregates to perform coordinated tasks

  using engineered cell-cell communication with chemical diffusion mechanisms

  such as quorum sensing.  Several of these

  manuscripts were featured in a Nature special collection of a select number of

  synthetic biology papers reflecting on the first 10 years of synthetic

  biology.  While work in the Weiss lab

  began mostly with prokaryotes, a majority of research in the lab has since shifted

  to mammalian synthetic biology. The lab focuses both on foundational research,

  e.g. creating general methods to improve our ability to engineer reliable and

  predictive multicellular biological systems, as well as pursuing specific

  health related applications where synthetic biology provides transformative

  capabilities, such as cancer immunotherapy (RNA synthetic biology research from

  the Weiss lab has recently been translated to the clinic), vaccination, auto-immune

  diseases, and programmable organoids
