bio: "Hi! I’m Libi Matityahoo, an undergraduate majoring in Course 2A-20
  (Mechanical and Biological Engineering). My dream is to address health
  challenges through biomedical engineering by combining creativity, design, and
  technology. I’m especially drawn to projects that merge mechanics, biology,
  neuroscience, and human-centered innovation.

  Outside of science, I’m a maker, athlete, and traveler. I played for the
  National U20 Israeli Women's Basketball Team and now represent MIT on the
  Varsity team. I love 3D printing, painting, baking, and discovering new
  cultures. I'm always down to meet new people, try new things, and
  travel to new places:)\n"
