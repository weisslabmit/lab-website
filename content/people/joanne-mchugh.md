bio: >
  Joanne McHugh is filling in for Darlene Ray through mid-to-late January 2026
  as the Administrative Assistant in MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering
  (BE), supporting Professor Ron Weiss, Professor Pete Dedon, and their
  laboratory teams. She is excited to work alongside such a dedicated and
  collaborative group within BE.
   
  Joanne’s MIT career has spanned over several departments, including the Sloan School of Management, Mechanical Engineering’s Sea Grant College Program, Lincoln Laboratory’s Ethics & Compliance Assurance Office, and most recently, the Center for Real Estate (CRE) within the School of Architecture and Planning (SA+P).
   
  Outside of work, Joanne enjoys camping, hiking, biking, skiing, golfing, volunteering, and spending time with family and friends. Each summer, she serves as a camp counselor at Exceptional Citizens Week (EC Week) in Pembroke, MA, a weeklong overnight camp for children and adults with special needs. She has also provided respite foster care for children and teens—experiences she finds deeply rewarding.
