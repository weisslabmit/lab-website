    "abstract": "The proposed research will use genetically engineered stem cells capable of autoregulating their differentiation into insulin-producing beta cells by incorporating artificial cell-cell communication and carefully regulated multistep differentiation. The overall goal is to model an artificial tissue homeostasis system which contains regulatory elements that will allow cells to detect stem cell and beta cell populations and differentiate appropriately depending on cell population thresholds. Steps toward this goal will be carried out by controlling the differentiation of mES into pancreatic beta cells in vitro. The proposal integrates the multidisciplinary areas of synthetic, computational, and developmental biology; biological and tissue engineering; and modeling/computational and stem cell biology. Signaling elements are used in the first step of differentiation (ES cells into endoderm) where the native alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is used to regulate expression of red fluorescent protein and allows for the visualization of mES transition into endoderm by cells) is?nfluorescence microscopy. The second step of differentiation (into beta visualized by GFP expression (from the Mouse Insulin Promoter (MIP)), which is caused by natural insulin production. These experimental observations will direct the forward-engineering of the synthetic autoregulating system. Project Outcomes: The goal of this research is to demonstrate a paradigm shift in tissue engineering and diabetes treatment: Genetically engineered stem cells do autoregulate their differentiation into insulin- producing β cells based on artificial cell-cell communication and programmed multistep differentiation. Additionally, we explore the computational design and modeling of an artificial tissue homeostasis system where transplanted engineered cells are programmed to regenerate and sustain the β cell population in a diabetic patient. We made good experimental progress towards optimizing an artificial cell-cell communication based on a small diffusible molecule in mammalian cells, a critical step for engineering autoregulated growth. Additionally, we laid the theoretical (design and modeling) foundation for a complete autoregulatory system. In parallel, we are engineering and characterizing the modules eeded for the complete homeostatic system (genetic toggle switch, relaxation oscillator, quorum sensing...). Engineering mouse embryonic stem cells with multiple variants of our genetic differentiation programs were brought to differentiate over endoderm-like stages to cells positive for insulin secretion by-products. By investigating these differentiated cells (e.g. glucose-dependent secretion, pancreatic beta cells markers) we are currently deciding on the best genetic program to generate such cells. Initially using lentiviruses to deliver the transgenes, we improved the fidelity andprecision of the chromosomal integrations drastically by developing a novel system to assemble and integrate site-specifically large gene circuits into mammalian cells. Such a system allows for a safe and controlled insertion of therapeutic genetic circuits into patient stem cells, with the potential of being able to generate large quantities of well-defined specialized cells needed for therapies. We could demonstrate that a single site-specifically integrated gene circuit is able to induce the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells to endoderm. We plan to disseminate this new DNA assembly and integration as we believe that it will be of high value to researchers working in mammalian synthesis biology in particular, or anyone performing mammalian (therapeutic) genetic engineering in general.

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made towards engineering both single-cell and multi-cellular systems through a combination of synthetic and systems biology,nanobiotechnology, pharmaceutical  science,  and  computational  approaches.However, our ability to engineer systems that begin to approach the complexity ofnatural pathways is severely limited by important challenges, e.g. due to noise, orthe fluctuations in gene expression and molecular species at multiple scales (e.g.both intra- and inter-cellular fluctuations). This barrier to engineering requires thatbiological noise be recognized as a design element with fundamentals that can beactively controlled. Here we highlight studies of an emerging discipline that collectively strives to engineer noise towards predictive stochastic design using interdisciplinary approaches at multiple-scales in diverse living systems.",

An important element in designing and implementing these circuits is matching logic gates such that the couplings produce the correct behavior. In this paper, we report in-vivo experimental results that examine and optimize the steady state behavior of cellular logic gates and genetic circuits synthesized in our lab. The optimized gates have the desired input/output characteristics for constructing robust genetic logic circuits of signiﬁcant complexity.",

    "abstract": "We describe a system that provides query based associative access to the contents of distributed information servers. In typical distributed information systems there are so many objects that underconstrained queries can produce large result sets and extraordinary processing costs. To deal with this scaling problem we use content labels to permit users to learn about available resources and to formulate queries with adequate discriminatory power. We have implemented associative access to a distributed set of information servers in the content routing system. A content routing system is a hierarchy of servers called content routers that present a single query based image of a distributed information system. We have successfully used a prototype content routing system to locate documents on several user file systems and on a large number of information servers.",

    "abstract": "We have built an HTTP based resource discovery system called Discover that provides a single point of access to over 500 WAIS servers. Discover provides two key services: query refinement and query routing. Query refinement helps a user improve a query fragment to describe the user's interests more precisely. Once a query has been refined and describes a manageable result set, query routing automatically forwards the query to the WAIS servers that contain relevant documents. Abbreviated descriptions of WAIS sites called content labels are used by the query refinement and query routing algorithms. Our experimental results suggest that query refinement in conjunction with the query routing provides an effective way to discover resources in a large universe of documents. Our experience with query refinement has convinced us that the expansion of query fragments is essential in helping one use a large, dynamically changing, heterogenous distributed information system.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in microfabrication and nanotechnology will enable the inexpensive manufacturing of massive numbers of tiny computing elements with sensors and actuators. New programming paradigms are required for obtaining organized and coherent behavior from the cooperation of large numbers of unreliable processing elements that are interconnected in unknown, irregular, and possibly time-varying ways. Amorphous computing is the study of developing and programming such ultrascale computing environments. This paper presents an approach to programming an amorphous computer by spontaneously organizing an unstructured collection of processing elements into cooperative groups and hierarchies. This paper introduces a structure called an AC Hierarchy, which logically organizes processors into groups at different levels of granularity. The AC hierarchy simplifies programming of an amorphous computer through new language abstractions, facilitates the design of efficient and robust algorithms, and simplifies the analysis of their performance. Several example applications are presented that greatly benefit from the AC hierarchy. This paper introduces three algorithms for constructing multiple levels of the hierarchy from an unstructured collection of processors.",

In this paper, we propose and analyze a new genetic signal processing circuit that can be configured to detect various chemical concentration ranges of ligand molecules. These molecules freely diffuse from the environment into the cell. The circuit detects acyl-homoserine lactone ligand molecules, determines if the molecular concentration falls within two prespecified thresholds, and reports the outcome with a fluorescent protein. In the analysis of the circuit and the description of preliminary experimental results, we demonstrate how to adjust the concentration band thresholds by altering the kinetic properties of specific genetic elements, such as ribosome binding site efficiencies or dna-binding protein affinities to their operators.",

    "abstract": "We propose a mapping from digital logic circuits into genetic regulatory networks with the following property: the chemical activity of such a genetic network in vivo implements the computation specified by the corresponding digital circuit. Logic signals are represented by the synthesis rates of cytoplasmic DNA binding proteins. Gates consist of structural genes for output proteins, fused to promoter/operator regions that are regulated by input proteins. The modular approach for building gates allows a free choice of signal proteins and thus enables the construction of complex circuits. This paper presents simulation results that demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Furthermore, a technique for measuring gate input/output characteristics is introduced. We will use this technique to evaluate gates constructed in our laboratory. Finally, this paper outlines automated logic design and presents BioSpice, a prototype system for the design and verification of genetic digital circuits.",

    "abstract": "The construction of artificial networks of transcriptional control elements in living cells represents a new frontier for biological engineering. However, biological circuit engineers will have to confront their inability to predict the precise behavior of even the most simple synthetic networks, a serious shortcoming and challenge for the design and construction of more sophisticated genetic circuitry in the future. We propose a combined rational and evolutionary design strategy for constructing genetic regulatory circuits, an approach that allows the engineer to fine-tune the biochemical parameters of the networks experimentally in vivo. By applying directed evolution to genes comprising a simple genetic circuit, we demonstrate that a nonfunctional circuit containing improperly matched components can evolve rapidly into a functional one. In the process, we generated a library of genetic devices with a range of behaviors that can be used to construct more complex circuits.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a high-frequency electronic biosensor of parallel-plate geometry that is embedded within a microfluidic device. This novel biosensor allows us to perform dielectric spectroscopy on a variety of biological samples—from cells to molecules—in solution. Because it is purely electronic, the sensor allows for rapid characterization with no sample preparation or chemical alteration. In addition, it is capable of probing length scales from millimeters to microns over a frequency range 50 MHz to 40 GHz, and sample volumes as small as picoliters [1,2]. Our high-frequency biosensor has evolved from previous device designs based on a coplanar waveguide (CPW) geometry [2]. For our current device, we employ microfluidic tectonics (µFT) [3] to embed two microstrip conductors within a microfluidic channel. The electronic coupling between the two conductors is greater than in our previous CPW design and more importantly, leads to an enhanced sensitivity. Our utilization of µFT allows us to incorporate easily this high-frequency electronic biosensor with a variety of lab-on-a-chip architectures. Device Description Figure 1 is a schematic of our high-frequency electronic biosensor. We fabricate this sensor by first depositing a 500 Å seed layer of gold onto two glass microscope slides. We then use photolithography to pattern the gold that is subsequently electroplated to a thickness of 4-6 µm. After reactive-ion etching the photoresist and removing the unplated gold with a standard iodine-based gold etchant, we align the two slides under a microscope such that the microstrip conductors overlap one another in a parallel-plate geometry (80 µm x 500 µm). We control the separation between the microstrip conductors using gold foil spacers 3–25 µm thick. The foil additionally ensures coupling between the grounds on each slide. Following alignment, we employ µFT to bond the two glass slides together and to create a microfluidic channel running perpendicular to the microstrip conductors (see Figure 1). We complete the device by inserting 0.02” ID vinyl tubing through predrilled input and output holes of the device [3]. All of our devices are designed to have a 50 Ω matched impedance and minimal insertion loss for 0.05 – 40 GHz. With these characteristics, we expect a sensitivity of 0.05 dB. Results By accessing frequencies &gt; 20 GHz with our device, we can probe unique low-frequency vibrational or rotational modes of bio-macromolecules, since at these frequencies the counterions have fully relaxed, the dipole moment of water is rapidly decreasing, and the macroscopic distortions of macromolecules become important and are reflected in the obtained spectra. As a first demonstration, we have measured PCR products. We are able to distinguish between non-reacted primers for PCR amplification and reacted PCR products (24 amplification cycles). Figure 2 shows representative spectra of the two different DNA solutions obtained from a single device and scaled to DI water. We have obtained similar spectral features from additional devices and are currently developing a quantitative model to explain our results. This initial demonstration of molecular differentiation using a high-frequency electronic biosensor shows the great promise of electronic biosensing.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic genetic circuits are artificial networks of transcriptional control elements inserted into living cells in order to 'program' cellular behavior. We can extend this application to programming population behavior by incorporating cell-cell communications capabilities. By designing and building such networks, cellular circuit engineers expect to gain insight into how natural genetic networks function with remarkable robustness, stability, and adaptability to changing environments. Programmed cells also have promising applications in biotechnology and medicine. A major challenge that biological circuit engineers face is the difficulty of predicting circuit performance at the design stage, with the consequence that actual construction requires significant experimental effort, even for very simple circuits. To address this fundamental obstacle we propose the use of laboratory evolution methods to create new circuit components and optimize circuit performance inside living cells.",

To accomplishthis goal, we begin with a genetic component library and a biocircuitdesign methodology for assembling these components into compoundcircuits. The main challenge in biocircuit design lies in selectingwell-matched genetic components that when coupled, reliably producethe desired behavior. We use simulation tools to guide circuitdesign, a process that consists of selecting the appropriatecomponents and genetically modifying existing components until thedesired behavior is achieved. In addition to such rational design, wealso employ directed evolution to optimize genetic circuitbehavior. Building on Nature's fundamental principle of evolution,this unique process directs cells to mutate their own DNA until theyfind gene network configurations that exhibit the desired systemcharacteristics. The integration of all the above capabilities infuture synthetic gene networks will enable cells to performsophisticated digital and analog computation, both asindividual entities and as part of larger cell communities. Thisengineering discipline and its associated tools will advance thecapabilities of genetic engineering, and allow us to harness cells fora myriad of applications not previously achievable.",

    "abstract": "One of the important challenges in the emerging field of synthetic biology is designing artificial networks that achieve coordinated behavior in cell communities. Here we present a synthetic multicellular bacterial system where receiver cells exhibit transient gene expression in response to a long-lasting signal from neighboring sender cells. The engineered sender cells synthesize an inducer, an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), which freely diffuses to spatially proximate receiver cells. The receiver cells contain a pulse-generator circuit that incorporates a feed-forward regulatory motif. The circuit responds to a long-lasting increase in the level of AHL by transiently activating, and then repressing, the expression of a GFP. Based on simulation models, we engineered variants of the pulse-generator circuit that exhibit different quantitative responses such as increased duration and intensity of the pulse. As shown by our models and experiments, the maximum amplitude and timing of the pulse depend not only on the final inducer concentration, but also on its rate of increase. The ability to differentiate between various rates of increase in inducer concentrations affords the system a unique spatiotemporal behavior for cells grown on solid media. Specifically, receiver cells can respond to communication from nearby sender cells while completely ignoring communication from senders cells further away, despite the fact that AHL concentrations eventually reach high levels everywhere. Because of the resemblance to naturally occurring feed-forward motifs, the pulse generator can serve as a model to improve our understanding of such systems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we use two synthetic gene networks, a transcriptional cascade and a pulse generating network, to study the efficacy of a simple statistical parameter fitting algorithm. The fitting was performed on experimental data and computer-generated data (to test how well the algorithm works under ideal conditions with perfect information). Most of the experimental parameter estimations yielded tight ranges of kinetic values for both gene networks. However, the results using simulated data indicate that the algorithm was able to provide better parameter estimates for the pulse generating network than for the transcriptional cascade. This is likely a result of the larger amount of time-series data available for the pulse generator and its greater level of phenotypical complexity, leading to tighter constraints for optimization. The variation in the magnitudes of the standard deviations between parameter estimates may give an indication of system sensitivity to specific kinetic rate constants. In the future, we also plan to verify the experimental results by constructing network variants and attempting to predict behaviors using values obtained in this study.",

The forward engineering of such multi-signal systems in synthetic biology has a number of important applications including biosensing, tissue engineering, and biomaterial fabrication. In addition, such synthetic systems provide a testing ground for quantitatively studying the fundamental principles governing similar natural genetic networks. However, an initial requirement for engineering multi-signal networks is the characterization and tuning of various properties of the signaling systems, including crosstalk, receiver response strength, and sensitivity. We characterize crosstalk interactions for synthetic receivers built from components of the Las and Rhl quorum sensing systems from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Next, we present results from genetic constructs designed to amplify weak transcriptional responses to signaling molecules. We then discuss results from directed evolution of receptor proteins to optimize receiver sensitivity. These methods of engineering synthetic constructs with desired response strengths and sensitivities to external signals have a number of important applications in their own right, such as the development of biosensors for detection of trace amounts of toxins. In addition to the experimental results that show how signaling constructs can be optimized for such applications, we present simulations for two example pattern formation systems that can be constructed from these tuned components.",

    "abstract": "The nascent field of synthetic biology is focused on creating small synthetic genetic networks inserting them into living cells in order to \"program\" cellular behavior. Recent prototypes include a toggle switch, an oscillator, logic gates, concentration band detectors, and even a pulse generator. Synthetic gene networks are foreseen to have tremendous applications in biotechnology, medicine, and defense related areas. Such engineered biological devices will engage in simple computations and cell-cell communications to diagnose diseases, repair tissues, detect and clean up environmental pollutants, and manufacture biomaterials. The main challenge in synthetic biology is creating and tuning gene networks to desired specifications. There is currently no formal mechanism to guarantee the behavior of these systems and to tune their parameters a-priori to satisfy desired performances. The existing tools for formal analysis cannot handle genetic networks successfully due to nonlinearities, uncertainties, scarce knowledge of kinetic and regulatory parameters, and measurements corrupted by noise. However, the adoption of synthetic gene networks in critical applications such as tissue engineering requires that these systems meet strict safety guarantees. In this project, we propose a hybrid systems approach to forward engineer and analyze synthetic genetic networks. In this framework, interval-based specifications translate to reachability analysis and safety verification, which are the central problems of formal analysis. By exploiting the particular nonlinearities induced by chemical reactions and cooperative regulations, we first reduce these infinite dimensional problems to finite searches on graphs by constructing discrete abstractions, and then map them to parameter value intervals. This procedure will allow for analysis under parameter uncertainty and will provide a provably correct methodology to tune the parameters to achieve desired interval-based properties. We will validate our approach with two experimental systems. We will improve the steady state digital response of a transcriptional cascade and use the optimized cascades to build more robust toggle switches. We will also use formal analysis to fine-tune the dynamic behavior of a pulse generator that incorporates cell-cell communication and a feed-forward motif.",

Here we demonstrate that by coupling gene expression to cell survival and death using cell–cell communication, we can programme the dynamics of a population despite variability in the behaviour of individual cells. Specifically, we have built and characterized a ‘population control’ circuit that autonomously regulates the density of an Escherichia coli population. The cell density is broadcasted and detected by elements from a bacterial quorum-sensing system13,14, which in turn regulate the death rate. As predicted by a simple mathematical model, the circuit can set a stable steady state in terms of cell density and gene expression that is easily tunable by varying the stability of the cell–cell communication signal. This circuit incorporates a mechanism for programmed death in response to changes in the environment, and allows us to probe the design principles of its more complex natural counterparts.",

    "abstract": "The precise nature of information flow through a biological network, which is governed by factors such as response sensitivities and noise propagation, greatly affects the operation of biological systems. Quantitative analysis of these properties is often difficult in naturally occurring systems but can be greatly facilitated by studying simple synthetic networks. Here, we report the construction of synthetic transcriptional cascades comprising one, two, and three repression stages. These model systems enable us to analyze sensitivity and noise propagation as a function of network complexity. We demonstrate experimentally steady-state switching behavior that becomes sharper with longer cascades. The regulatory mechanisms that confer this ultrasensitive response both attenuate and amplify phenotypical variations depending on the system's input conditions. Although noise attenuation allows the cascade to act as a low-pass filter by rejecting short-lived perturbations in input conditions, noise amplification results in loss of synchrony among a cell population. The experimental results demonstrating the above network properties correlate well with simulations of a simple mathematical model of the system.",

    "abstract": "The ability to redesign and even build completely new biological entities offers revolutionary opportunities for using biology to solve human problems. The dream, however, far outstrips the reality: engineering new biological machines, programming cells behaviors, and building new forms of life pose huge technical and conceptual challenges. Our research is designed to make some important first steps, by developing generally-applicable engineering methods for building synthetic gene networks. Implementation of even the most simple circuits in a biological system requires tedious optimization of a large number of poorly-understood parameters, many of which can neither be measured nor easily manipulated. Simulations can sometimes guide optimization, but we believe that biological systems are best optimized using nature's editing strategy, evolution. We believe that a combined approach of rational design based on computational predictions coupled with directed evolution-making mutations in the laboratory and selecting those organisms exhibiting the desired behaviors--will be fundamental to the progress of synthetic biology. We will in effect learn how to 'breed' useful synthetic gene networks, just as we have learned how to breed useful plants and animals. This approach mimics natural evolution in exploring the vast and complex landscape of functions available to a set of molecules making up an engineered regulatory pathway. Importantly, it circumvents our near-complete ignorance of how a DNA sequence encodes a specific set of biological functions, a detailed understanding that is required for any 'rational' design approach. By introducing random mutations into the DNA and screening for different functions that might be expressed by the mutant circuits, we can identify which functions are possible as well as the ranges of function available to the specific search process (e.g. random point mutation targeted to a specific gene). With further analysis, e.g. sequencing to identify the mutations and biochemical analysis of circuit components, we gain insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the overall function is achieved or modified. In this project we have three specific aims. The first is to validate a 'selection module' by which we can efficiently evolve components and circuits in the laboratory. This module connects proper circuit function to the ability of cells that express it to survive and grow. Cells with functioning circuits survive and grow; those that have not solved the problem do not. To program complex behaviors, we will also need components that respond to predefined ranges of input parameters with predictable output parameters. Thus our second aim is to use directed evolution to create a range of transcriptional activators based on the well-characterized framework protein, LuxR. Laboratory-evolved LuxR variants will activate gene transcription at different, nonnatural promoter sites on the DNA. Finally, we propose to investigate the range of circuit functions available to a predefined set of components via evolutionary exploration. Specifically, we will evolve a series of 'band detect' circuits that respond to a prespecified range of acyl-HSL concentrations. These circuits will be used to construct synthetic systems that form patterns of gene expression in the solid phase. Our ultimate goal is to develop a fundamental enabling technology for synthetic biology as well as for developing bio-inspired modes and architectures for computing. We envision that evolved circuits and the synthetic multicellular systems that can be constructed from them will be useful to researchers developing quantitative models of gene regulation, quorum sensing, and other aspects of cellular computing.",

    "abstract": "Biological pattern formation is an elaborate process that requires spatiotemporal coordination of cellular activities. To-date, research has focused on studying naturally occurring patterns either by devising abstract models that explain the formation of these patterns or by characterizing relevant genetic circuits and biochemical interactions. The knowledge gained from understanding how cells form patterns has practical applications in tissue engineering, biosensing, and biomaterial fabrication. However, to fully realize the potential of these applications one must be able to form arbitrary patterns, e.g. tissues with new arrangements of cells. Existing efforts to coerce cells to form particular patterns have largely focused on setting up scaffolds and appropriate environmental conditions, but such efforts are limited because they rely on the cells' existing genetic circuitry. The approach in this project is fundamentally different: the focus is to engineer de novo patterns by building synthetic gene networks and in the process gain a greater understanding of pattern formation. The project strives to create a new engineering discipline for generating user-specified artificial differentiation patterns. The main component of this discipline is the tight integration of modeling tools with experimental work. Based on these models, novel genetic circuits will be built and validated experimentally. These circuits will direct cells to form stable and dynamic spatiotemporal gene expression patterns - lines, standing waves, Turing Patterns, Conway's Game of Life, and branched structures. Results from the project will serve as the basis for a pattern formation toolkit that will be used to engineer more complex patterns, enable future applications, and elucidate the underlying principles governing natural pattern formation. The research outlined here will have a broad impact both in academia and industry. This project will advance knowledge in a number of important areas in systems biology including the understanding of robust gene networks, noise in gene expression, gene regulation, cell-cell communications, in addition to providing mathematical models for intracellular and intercellular systems. Research in multicellular pattern formation is not only fundamental to understanding organism development and coordinated cell behavior, but also has practical applications. For example, micro-pattern formation will benefit nanotechnology where such patterns could be used for bacterial nano-fabrication. Also, the ability to construct synthetic patterns will contribute to the field of tissue engineering, where such patterns could be utilized to differentiate stem cells into tissues and organs. In the long term, knowledge gained from this research into the coordination of cell behaviors will be applicable to areas outside of biology, including the design of robust multi-agent systems such as computer networks. Perhaps the most important contribution will be through the multidisciplinary education of students and future leaders in the field. This will be accomplished through various activities including the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and the Synthetic Biology Summer Program, where the focus is on recruiting and providing specific funding for underrepresented minorities and women.",

To deal with this problem, we propose a method for the analysis of genetic regulatory networks with parameter uncertainty. We consider models based on piecewise-multiaffine differential equations, dynamical properties expressed in temporal logic, and intervals for the values of uncertain parameters. The problem is then either to guarantee that the system satisfies the expected properties for every possible parameter value - the corresponding parameter set is then called valid - or to find valid subsets of a given parameter set. The proposed method uses discrete abstractions and model checking, and allows for efficient search of the parameter space. This approach has been implemented in a tool for robust verification of gene networks (RoVerGeNe) and applied to the tuning of a synthetic network build in E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Small changes in transcriptional activity often significantly affect phenotype but are not detectable in vivo by conventional means. To address this problem, we present a technique for detecting weak transcriptional responses using signal-amplifying genetic circuits. We apply this technique to reveal previously undetectable log phase responses of several Rhl quorum sensing controlled (qsc) promoters from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Genetic circuits with Rhl promoters and transcriptional amplification components were built and tested in Escherichia coli. This enabled us to isolate the behavior of the promoters under study from Las and quinolone interactions. To amplify qsc promoter responses to acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL), the highly efficient λ repressor gene was placed downstream of several Rhl promoters and coupled to a fluorescent reporter under the control of the λ P(R) promoter. With amplification, up to ∼100-fold differences in fluorescence levels between AHL induced and noninduced cultures were observed for promoters whose responses were otherwise not detectable. In addition, the combination of using signal amplification and performing experiments in E. coli simplified the analysis of AHL signal crosstalk. For example, we discovered that while a C4HSL/RhlR complex activates both qscrhlA and qscphzA1, a 3OC12HSL/RhlR complex activates qscphzA1 but not qscrhlA in our system. This crosstalk information is particularly important since one of the potential uses of amplification constructs is for the detection of specific quorum sensing signals in environmental and clinical isolates. Furthermore, the process of decomposing networks into basic parts, isolating these components in a well-defined background, and using amplification to characterize both crosstalk and cognate signal responses embodies an important approach to understanding complex genetic networks. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Recent achievements include the development of sophisticated non-native behaviors such as bi-stability, oscillations, proteins customized for biosensing, optimized drug synthesis and programmed spatial pattern formation. The de novo construction of such systems offers valuable quantitative insight into naturally occurring information processing activities.

    "abstract": "Precise control of stem cell differentiation offers tremendous potential for tissue engineering. Synthetic gene networks provide a framework for understanding and engineering life. We propose to use synthetic gene networks to engineer circuits that dictate the cell fate of embryonic stem (ES) cells by controlling gene expression. These networks will be capable of turning on cell fate regulator genes in stem cells at precise times and under well-controlled and well-defined conditions based on external stimuli and the internal state of the cell. The over-expression of these cell fate regulator genes is sufficient to trigger particular differentiation path ways in ES cells. We have implemented a lentivirus delivered 1:2 multiplexer circuit for programmed differentiation. This network uses a transactivator, a repressor and one small molecule input Doxycycline (Dox). Dox selects to activate one of two cell fate regulator gene outputs, thereby pushing the ES cell along one of two differentiation pathways. Preliminary results demonstrate the ability to switch between the expression of two fluorescent proteins - EGFP and DsRed-Express based on the external input Dox. Upon integration of the cell fate regulators MyoD and Nanog into this circuit, ES cells will either differentiate into muscle or maintain their undifferentiated state. Characterization of this simple network in mammalian cells is an important first step as this circuit will serve as a basis for building more complex networks that can select between many outputs using only a few inputs to form structures that resemble complex tissues like the spinal cord.",

We simulate a variety of transcriptional networks using a stochastic model and report two main findings. First, intrinsic noise is not attenuated by the addition of negative or positive feedback to transcriptional cascades. Second, for multigene negative feedback networks, synchrony in oscillations among a cell population can be improved by increasing network depth and tightening the regulation at one of the repression stages. Our long term goal is to understand how the noise characteristics of complex networks can be derived from the properties of modules that are used to compose these networks.",

Moreover, these models present interesting mathematical properties that allow the development of efficient algorithms for solving robustness analyses and tuning problems.

Consortia abound in nature, and their cooperative metabolic activities influence everything from biodiversity in the global food chain to human weight gain. Here, we present an engineered consortium in which the microbial members communicate with each other and exhibit a “consensus” gene expression response. Two colocalized populations of\n              Escherichia coli\n              converse bidirectionally by exchanging acyl-homoserine lactone signals. The consortium generates the gene-expression response if and only if both populations are present at sufficient cell densities. Because neither population can respond without the other's signal, this consensus function can be considered a logical AND gate in which the inputs are cell populations. The microbial consensus consortium operates in diverse growth modes, including in a biofilm, where it sustains its response for several days.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that intracellular variations in the rate of gene expression are of fundamental importance to cellular function and development. While such ‘noise’ is often considered detrimental in the context of perturbing genetic systems, it can be beneficial in processes such as species diversification and facilitation of evolution. A major difficulty in exploring such effects is that the magnitude and spectral properties of the induced variations arise from some intrinsic cellular process that is difficult to manipulate. Here, we present two designs of a molecular noise generator that allow for the flexible modulation of the noise profile of a target gene. The first design uses a dual-signal mechanism that enables independent tuning of the mean and variability of an output protein. This is achieved through the combinatorial control of two signals that regulate transcription and translation separately. We then extend the design to allow for DNA copy-number regulation, which leads to a wider tuning spectrum for the output molecule. To gain a deeper understanding of the circuit's functionality in a realistic environment, we introduce variability in the input signals in order to ascertain the degree of noise induced by the control process itself. We conclude by illustrating potential applications of the noise generator, demonstrating how it could be used to ascertain the robust or fragile properties of a genetic circuit.",

    "abstract": "The lack of precise numerical information for the values of biological parameters severely limits the development and analysis of models of genetic regulatory networks. To deal with this problem, we propose a method for the analysis of genetic regulatory networks under parameter uncertainty. We consider models based on piecewise-multiaffine differential equations, dynamical properties expressed in temporal logic, and intervals for the values of uncertain parameters. The problem is then either to guarantee that the system satisfies the expected properties for every possible parameter value-the corresponding parameter set is then called valid-or to find valid subsets of a given parameter set. The proposed method uses discrete abstractions and model checking and allows for efficient search of the parameter space. However, the abstraction process creates spurious behaviors in the abstract systems, along which time does not progress. Consequently, the verification of liveness properties, expressing that something will eventually happen, and implicitly assuming progress of time, often fails. A solution to this second problem is proposed using the notion of transient regions. This approach has been implemented in a tool for robust verification of gene networks and applied to the tuning of a synthetic network built in E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Biological pattern formation is an elaborate process that requires spatiotemporal coordination of cellular activities. To-date, research has focused on studying naturally occurring patterns either by devising abstract models that explain the formation of these patterns or by characterizing relevant genetic circuits and biochemical interactions. The knowledge gained from understanding how cells form patterns has practical applications in tissue engineering, biosensing, and biomaterial fabrication. However, to fully realize the potential of these applications one must be able to form arbitrary patterns, e.g. tissues with new arrangements of cells. Existing efforts to coerce cells to form particular patterns have largely focused on setting up scaffolds and appropriate environmental conditions, but such efforts are limited because they rely on the cells' existing genetic circuitry. The approach in this project is fundamentally different: the focus is to engineer de novo patterns by building synthetic gene networks and in the process gain a greater understanding of pattern formation. The project strives to create a new engineering discipline for generating user-specified artificial differentiation patterns. The main component of this discipline is the tight integration of modeling tools with experimental work. Based on these models, novel genetic circuits will be built and validated experimentally. These circuits will direct cells to form stable and dynamic spatiotemporal gene expression patterns - lines, standing waves, Turing Patterns, Conway's Game of Life, and branched structures. Results from the project will serve as the basis for a pattern formation toolkit that will be used to engineer more complex patterns, enable future applications, and elucidate the underlying principles governing natural pattern formation. The research outlined here will have a broad impact both in academia and industry. This project will advance knowledge in a number of important areas in systems biology including the understanding of robust gene networks, noise in gene expression, gene regulation, cell-cell communications, in addition to providing mathematical models for intracellular and intercellular systems. Research in multicellular pattern formation is not only fundamental to understanding organism development and coordinated cell behavior, but also has practical applications. For example, micro-pattern formation will benefit nanotechnology where such patterns could be used for bacterial nano-fabrication. Also, the ability to construct synthetic patterns will contribute to the field of tissue engineering, where such patterns could be utilized to differentiate stem cells into tissues and organs. In the long term, knowledge gained from this research into the coordination of cell behaviors will be applicable to areas outside of biology, including the design of robust multi-agent systems such as computer networks. Perhaps the most important contribution will be through the multidisciplinary education of students and future leaders in the field. This will be accomplished through various activities including the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and the Synthetic Biology Summer Program, where the focus is on recruiting and providing specific funding for underrepresented minorities and women.",

    "abstract": "In the 'first wave' of synthetic biology, researchers developed basic elements and modules that allowed transcriptional, translational and post-translational control of cellular processes.The 'second wave' of synthetic biology, in which researchers must integrate these basic elements and modules to create systems-level circuitry, presents new challenges. Traditional principles for systems engineering must be supplemented with approaches that attend to details of biological systems and contexts.Several groups have developed small synthetic systems, including multicellular synthetic ecosystems in bacteria, yeast and mammalian cells; application-orientated systems, such as bacteria that sense and destroy tumours and organisms that produce drug precursors; and initial development of minimized cellular genomes.Many open questions and challenges remain, including the development of readily characterized, standardized and modular components; substantially reducing or exploiting biological noise in synthetic systems; determining the usefulness of innate or engineered epigenetic cellular functions; improving and creating new computational tools and programming abstractions for modelling and designing more complex systems; and determining safety issues and resolutions for clinical manifestations of synthetic biological systems.",

Engineering cells for detection and targeted destruction of pathogens offers a single integrated solution to eradicate multiple threats with an approach that is a rapid, selective, and highly sensitive. We are engineering a single cell type that detects chemical signals naturally produced by different classes of pathogens and initiates multiple specific responses, each tailored to particular members of the classes.

These will have an impact on future gene- and cell-based therapies and help bring drug discovery into a new era. The inventory of biological parts that are essential for life on this planet is becoming increasingly complete. The postgenomic era has provided encyclopedic information on gene-function correlations and systems biology is now delivering comprehensive details on the dynamics of biochemical reaction networks in living organisms. The time has come to reassemble these catalogued items and design new biological devices and systems with novel and useful functionality in a rational and systematic manner. This is the premise of synthetic biology, a constructive systems biology discipline likely to become the life science revolution of the 21(st) century.",

For example, anticancer therapies could be engineered to detect and respond to complex cellular conditions in individual cells with high specificity. Here, we show a scalable transcriptional/posttranscriptional synthetic regulatory circuit—a cell-type “classifier”—that senses expression levels of a customizable set of endogenous microRNAs and triggers a cellular response only if the expression levels match a predetermined profile of interest. We demonstrate that a HeLa cancer cell classifier selectively identifies HeLa cells and triggers apoptosis without affecting non-HeLa cell types. This approach also provides a general platform for programmed responses to other complex cell states.",

    "abstract": "Background The field of synthetic biology promises to revolutionize our ability to engineer biological systems, providing important benefits for a variety of applications. Recent advances in DNA synthesis and automated DNA assembly technologies suggest that it is now possible to construct synthetic systems of significant complexity. However, while a variety of novel genetic devices and small engineered gene networks have been successfully demonstrated, the regulatory complexity of synthetic systems that have been reported recently has somewhat plateaued due to a variety of factors, including the complexity of biology itself and the lag in our ability to design and optimize sophisticated biological circuitry. Methodology/Principal Findings To address the gap between DNA synthesis and circuit design capabilities, we present a platform that enables synthetic biologists to express desired behavior using a convenient high-level biologically-oriented programming language, Proto. The high level specification is compiled, using a regulatory motif based mechanism, to a gene network, optimized, and then converted to a computational simulation for numerical verification. Through several example programs we illustrate the automated process of biological system design with our platform, and show that our compiler optimizations can yield significant reductions in the number of genes () and latency of the optimized engineered gene networks. Conclusions/Significance Our platform provides a convenient and accessible tool for the automated design of sophisticated synthetic biological systems, bridging an important gap between DNA synthesis and circuit design capabilities. Our platform is user-friendly and features biologically relevant compiler optimizations, providing an important foundation for the development of sophisticated biological systems.",

    "abstract": "The overall aim of the project is to develop a robust platform for an array based detector that could sense, distinguish and quantify diverse collections of environmental analytes. We have previously developed cell based reporters that afford the ability to recognize a large number of chemicals, built around G-protein coupled receptors GPCRs, which provide high diversity and broad specificity. To render this detector system able to function in real time, we are applying synthetic biology approaches to engineer cells with a fast, phosphorylation based memory circuit. This solves two problems the readout is based on protein phosphorylation and thus occurs within seconds. Second, the response, once established, remains fixed, so that the readout can be analyzed without a transient loss of signal. In order to interpret the results we obtain from the proposed array detector, we have developed a Bayesian-based computational method for extracting the identities and amounts of compounds in a mixture. Applying our computation approach to results obtained with a prototype GPCR-based array, we were able to extract the identity and amounts of compounds in complex mixtures. This provides validation of the method, which could be of broad use for any array based detector system.",

There are many well-studied examples of robust systems in biology, and for the advancement of synthetic biology, particularly in performance-critical applications, fundamental understanding of how robustness is both achieved and maintained is very important. A synthetic circuit may fail to behave as expected for a multitude of reasons, and since many of these failures are difficult to predict a priori, a better understanding of a circuit’s behavior as well as its possible failures are needed. In this chapter, we outline work that has been done in developing design principles for robust synthetic circuits, as well as sharing our experiences designing and constructing gene circuits.",

To accomplish this, it is important to accurately characterize the behavior of biological devices. Prior characterization efforts, however, have generally not yielded enough high-quality information to enable compositional design. In the TASBE (A Tool-Chain to Accelerate Synthetic Biological Engineering) project we have developed a new characterization technique capable of producing such data.

    "abstract": "Densely arrayed skeletal myotubes are activated individually and as a group using precise optical stimulation with high spatiotemporal resolution. Skeletal muscle myoblasts are genetically encoded to express a light-activated cation channel, Channelrhodopsin-2, which allows for spatiotemporal coordination of a multitude of skeletal myotubes that contract in response to pulsed blue light. Furthermore, ensembles of mature, functional 3D muscle microtissues have been formed from the optogenetically encoded myoblasts using a high-throughput device. The device, called “skeletal muscle on a chip”, not only provides the myoblasts with controlled stress and constraints necessary for muscle alignment, fusion and maturation, but also facilitates the measurement of forces and characterization of the muscle tissue. We measured the specific static and dynamic stresses generated by the microtissues and characterized the morphology and alignment of the myotubes within the constructs. The device allows testing of the effect of a wide range of parameters (cell source, matrix composition, microtissue geometry, auxotonic load, growth factors and exercise) on the maturation, structure and function of the engineered muscle tissues in a combinatorial manner. Our studies integrate tools from optogenetics and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology with skeletal muscle tissue engineering to open up opportunities to generate soft robots actuated by a multitude of spatiotemporally coordinated 3D skeletal muscle microtissues.",

This competition affects also synthetic biology circuits, which may not behave as expected. The aims of this project are to 1 characterizequantify the effect of competition for RNAPs and ribosomes on synthetic genetic circuits 2 determine the extent to which RNAPs or ribosomes are limiting 3 develop models that predict the change of behavior of circuits due to competition 4 demonstrate the predictions on the design of a synthetic cascade. We have constructed a synthetic circuit in E. coli and characterized through theory and experiments the effect of competition on the expression of a constitutively expressed gene when a different inducible gene is activated. For this system, we have also developed predictive models, both analytical and computational. Our finding quantifies the extent of competition and provides initial tools to predict this effect. Our experimental results and models will enable design methods for next-generation circuits that are robust to competition to be investigated later.

    "abstract": "Modern breast cancer therapies utilize non-specific approaches to kill or remove cancerous cells, inflicting significant collateral damage to healthy cells. In response to the need for highly targeted detection and destruction of cancerous cells, we propose to implement multi-input genetic circuits that act as cell state classifiers based on mRNA or microRNA expression profiling. The mRNA sensing project is focused on the MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell line. MCF-7 cells overexpress Gata3, NPY1R and TFF1 mRNA relative to healthy cells. Based on our bioinformatics analysis, taking into account the three biomarkers allows for dramatically improved specificity in comparison to targeting single genes. We therefore design a three-input AND gate that triggers a response only when all three biomarkers are expressed above a defined threshold. In second approach we implement transcriptionalpost-transcriptional regulatory circuit that senses expression levels of a customizable set of endogenous microRNAs and computes whether to trigger a response if the expression levels match a pre-determined profile of interest. We have created a circuit that computes a complex abstract logic miR1 AND miR23 AND NOT miR4 AND NOTmiR5 AND NOT miR6 and selectively triggers output response in HeLa but not in other cells.",

However, it remains challenging to elucidate the underlying regulatory programs because differentiation protocols are laborious and often result in low neuron yields. Here, we overexpressed two Neurogenin transcription factors in human‐induced pluripotent stem cells and obtained neurons with bipolar morphology in 4 days, at greater than 90% purity. The high purity enabled\n              mRNA\n              and microRNA expression profiling during neurogenesis, thus revealing the genetic programs involved in the rapid transition from stem cell to neuron. The resulting cells exhibited transcriptional, morphological and functional signatures of differentiated neurons, with greatest transcriptional similarity to prenatal human brain samples. Our analysis revealed a network of key transcription factors and microRNAs that promoted loss of pluripotency and rapid neurogenesis via progenitor states. Perturbations of key transcription factors affected homogeneity and phenotypic properties of the resulting neurons, suggesting that a systems‐level view of the molecular biology of differentiation may guide subsequent manipulation of human stem cells to rapidly obtain diverse neuronal types.\n            \n          , \n            Synopsis\n            \n              \n                \n                  image\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Rapid and homogeneous neuronal differentiation is attained in human stem cells upon overexpression of two Neurogenin transcription factors.\n              mRNA\n              and miRNA expression profiling during differentiation reveals a regulatory network mediating neurogenesis from stem cells.\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  Neurogenin‐1 and ‐2 drive homogeneous differentiation of human stem cells into bipolar neurons in 4 days in defined media.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    The population homogeneity allowed\n                    mRNA\n                    and miRNA expression profiling over time during neurogenesis.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    A network of key transcription factors and mi\n                    RNA\n                    s that promote rapid neurogenesis and loss of pluripotency is identified.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Perturbations of key transcription factors affect the homogeneity and phenotypic properties of the resulting neurons.",

    "abstract": "Microscale robots offer an unprecedented opportunity to perform tasks at resolutions approaching 1 μm, but the great majority of research to this point focuses on actuation and control. Potential applications for microrobots can be considerably expanded by integrating sensing, signal processing and feedback into the system. In this work, we demonstrate that technologies from the field of synthetic biology may be directly integrated into microrobotic systems to create cell-based programmable mobile sensors, with signal processors and memory units. Specifically, we integrate genetically engineered, ultraviolet light-sensing bacteria with magnetic microrobots, creating the first controllable biological microrobot that is capable of exploring, recording and reporting on the state of the microscale environment. We demonstrate two proof-of-concept prototypes: (a) an integrated microrobot platform that is able to sense biochemical signals, and (b) a microrobot platform that is able to deploy biosensor payloads to monitor biochemical signals, both in a biological environment. These results have important implications for integrated micro-bio-robotic systems for applications in biological engineering and research.",

    "abstract": "Messenger RNA as a therapeutic modality is becoming increasingly popular in the field of gene therapy. The realization that nucleobase modifications can greatly enhance the properties of mRNA by reducing the immunogenicity and increasing the stability of the RNA molecule (the Kariko paradigm) has been pivotal for this revolution. Here we find that mRNAs containing the N1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ) modification alone and/or in combination with 5-methylcytidine (m5C) outperformed the current state-of-the-art pseudouridine (Ψ) and/or m5C/Ψ-modified mRNA platform by providing up to ~44-fold (when comparing double modified mRNAs) or ~13-fold (when comparing single modified mRNAs) higher reporter gene expression upon transfection into cell lines or mice, respectively. We show that (m5C/)m1Ψ-modified mRNA resulted in reduced intracellular innate immunogenicity and improved cellular viability compared to (m5C/)Ψ-modified mRNA upon in vitro transfection. The enhanced capability of (m5C/)m1Ψ-modified mRNA to express proteins may at least partially be due to the increased ability of the mRNA to evade activation of endosomal Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and downstream innate immune signaling. We believe that the (m5C/)m1Ψ-mRNA platform presented here may serve as a new standard in the field of modified mRNA-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Successful computing systems leverage their underlying technologies to solve problems humans simply cannot. Electronic systems harness the power of radio waves and electrons. Mechanical systems use physical force and physical interactions. Biological systems represent a computing paradigm that can harness evolution, adaptation, replication, self-repair, chemistry, and living organisms. Engineered, living biological systems which make decisions, process \"data\", record events, adapt to their environment, and communicate to one another will deliver exciting new solutions in bio-therapeutics, bio-materials, bio-energy, and bio-remediation. This project will create a quantitative set of freely available design principles, computational tools, mathematical models, physical biological artifacts, educational resources, and outreach activities. Once available, these resources will allow for novel, living biological solutions to be built more quickly, perform better, be more reliable to manufacture, and cost less to produce. This project is unique in that these resources will be explicitly developed to validate key computational concepts to understand how well these concepts can be applied rigorously and repeatedly to biology. This project decomposes these concepts into three areas: Computing Paradigm (digital, analog, memory, and communication), Computing Activity (specification, design, and verification), and Computing Metric (time, space, quality, and complexity). Once complete, this project will provide the most comprehensive, freely available, and computationally relevant set of building blocks to engineer biological systems to date. By developing the tools, techniques, and materials outlined in this project, this research will fundamentally change the way biological systems are specified, designed, assembled, and tested. Advanced bio-energy, bio-sensing, bio-therapeutics, and bio-materials all will become increasingly viable commercial technologies that can be made better, cheaper, faster, and more safely as a result of this project. The education of an entire new generation of engineers will occur through workshops, coursework, and community engagement activities. This new generation will have access to these approaches which will influence how biological computation is done and how that process is communicated to the community. This project will bring computational questions and methods to the forefront of biotechnology via an interdisciplinary research team focused not on one-off solutions but on foundational computing principles. Explicitly five unanswered questions will be addressed in this project: (1) What computational models are available to biology, what are their limits, and how do they perform? (2) What communication mechanisms are available to biology, what are their limits, and how do they perform? (3) What are the theoretical and empirical measures of quality, scale, time, and space in biological computing systems? (4) How generalizable are the concepts and \"design rules\" which can be learned from studying biological systems? (5) How can the results (data and learnings) from biological specification, design, and verification be authoritatively disseminated to the community as design principles and grand challenges? This project addresses these questions with an interdisciplinary team with expertise in theoretical computer science, electronic design automation, bio-physics/chemistry, control theory, and molecular cell biology. For more information visit www.programmingbiology.org. Project Outcomes: This NSF Expeditions in Computing Award created the Living Computing Project (https://www.programmingbiology.org/) which explored digital, analog, memory, and communication computational paradigms in living systems. These systems included engineered bacteria, mammalian cells, and yeast. This effort inserted programs into these organisms specifically designed to carry out deterministic functions. By allowing designers to think in terms of well know computing models, this research helped to create foundational concepts to engineer new therapeutics, materials, energy, and bio-sensors. Not only will the specification of these applications be more natural as a result of this effort, but also their design, fabrication, and test will be made more robust and efficient. These techniques will also allow for existing verification mechanisms to be employed to formally prove properties related to the functionality and performance of these systems. This award created physical-biological building blocks, experimental techniques, data standards, and formal metrics for the forward engineering of living systems that reflected common computational techniques. It also helped promote the concept of computing-inspired biology and expand the synthetic biology community to include more computer scientists, bioinformaticians, and engineers. This work funded over 60+ peer-reviewed journal and conference proceedings, 12 principle investigators, and over 25+ graduate students and postdocs. Researcher institutions included Boston University, MIT, MIT Lincoln Labs, and Raytheon BBN Technologies. In addition, it led to the creation of the STEM Pathways outreach program (https://www.stempathways.org/) which helped to introduce engineering biology concepts to undergraduate students. This program hosted multiple outreach events, International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition teams, and offered student research projects for over 50+ undergraduates over 5 years. It also helped create Advice to a Scientist (https://advicetoascientist.com/) which is a hub where the scientific community can share their perspective on topics that are central to the professional growth of scientists at all stages of their career - ranging from curious high school students at the beginning of their scientific journey to more seasoned science explorers. Our goal is to bring open-access and equitable mentorship opportunities and advice to anyone in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Highlights of the award include: Development and characterization of novel cell-cell communication systems. Domino: Recombinase-based digital logic systems and resource sharing paradigms illustrating the utility metrics have in system design and programing. Novel biophysical models created to both facilitate predictable modular construction as well as elucidate governing biophysics properties that can be used to optimize further biological circuitry. Overall we believe modular system development coupled with well defined metrics of performance based on governing biophysical properties will aid future generations of biological programs in areas of robustness and optimal development without the need to rediscover and redefine success for each application.

While most of the methods using these cells have focused on deriving homogenous populations of specialized cells, there has been modest success in producing hiPSC-derived organotypic tissues or organoids. Here we present a novel approach for generating and then co-differentiating hiPSC-derived progenitors. With a genetically engineered pulse of GATA-binding protein 6 (GATA6) expression, we initiate rapid emergence of all three germ layers as a complex function of GATA6 expression levels and tissue context. Within 2 weeks we obtain a complex tissue that recapitulates early developmental processes and exhibits a liver bud-like phenotype, including haematopoietic and stromal cells as well as a neuronal niche. Collectively, our approach demonstrates derivation of complex tissues from hiPSCs using a single autologous hiPSCs as source and generates a range of stromal cells that co-develop with parenchymal cells to form tissues.",

    "abstract": "Throughout biology, function is intimately linked with form. Across scales ranging from subcellular to multiorganismal, the identity and organization of a biological structure’s subunits dictate its properties. The field of molecular morphogenesis has traditionally been concerned with describing these links, decoding the molecular mechanisms that give rise to the shape and structure of cells, tissues, organs, and organisms. Recent advances in synthetic biology promise unprecedented control over these molecular mechanisms; this opens the path to not just probing morphogenesis but directing it. This review explores several frontiers in the nascent field of synthetic morphogenesis, including programmable tissues and organs, synthetic biomaterials and programmable matter, and engineering complex morphogenic systems de novo. We will discuss each frontier’s objectives, current approaches, constraints and challenges, and future potential.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n            \n              \n              As CHO cell line development for biotherapeutic production becomes more sophisticated through the availability of the CHO genome sequence, the ability to accurately and reproducibly engineer the host cell genome has become increasingly important. Multiple well characterized systems for site‐specific integration will enable more complex cell line engineering to generate cell lines with desirable attributes. We built and characterized a novel recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) system using Bxb1 integrase and compared it to the commonly used Flp/FRT RMCE system. We first integrated a DNA construct flanked by either Bxb1 attachment sites or FRT sequences (referred to as a landing pad) into the Fer1L4 genomic locus of CHO‐S cells using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homologous recombination. We characterized the resulting clones harboring either the Bxb1 or Flp/FRT landing pad using whole genome resequencing to compare their genomes with the parental host cell line. We determined that each landing pad was specifically integrated into the Fer1L4 locus in the selected clones and observed no major structural changes in the genome or variations in copy number as a result of CRISPR/Cas9 modification. We subsequently tested the ability of the Bxb1 and Flp/FRT landing pad clones to perform proper RMCE with donor vectors containing identical mAb expression cassettes flanked by either Bxb1 attachment sites or FRT sites. We demonstrated that both RMCE systems were able to generate stable pools in a similar time frame with comparable mAb expression. Through genetic characterization of up to 24 clones derived from either system, we determined that the BxB1 RMCE system yielded higher fidelity RMCE events than the Flp/FRT system as evidenced by a higher percentage of clones with expected integration of the mAb cassette into the landing pad in the respective cell lines. We conclude that Bxb1 RMCE is an excellent alternative to Flp/FRT RMCE and valuable addition to our toolbox enabling the engineering of more sophisticated cell lines for biotherapeutic production.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new algorithm to infer temporal logic properties of a system from data consisting of a set of finite time system traces. We propose an algorithm that generates a Signal Temporal Logic formula by discretizing the entire domain and codomain of the system traces. Unlike many popular inference algorithms which require labeled data that represents whether a trace exhibits a desired behavior (positive) or not (negative), this approach only requires positive traces to infer temporal logic properties. We present two case studies to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The first is a biological network consisting of a genetic logic circuit in a bacterial cell. The second is a fault detection problem in automotive powertrain systems. We also compare the performance of the algorithm with an existing inference algorithm.",

However, the construction of RNA-encoded multilayer networks is still limited by the availability of composable and orthogonal regulatory devices. Here, we report on control of mRNA translation with newly engineered RBPs regulated by viral proteases in mammalian cells. By combining post-transcriptional and post-translational control, we expand the operational landscape of RNA-encoded genetic circuits with a set of regulatory devices including: i) RBP-protease, ii) protease-RBP, iii) protease–protease, iv) protein sensor protease-RBP, and v) miRNA-protease/RBP interactions. The rational design of protease-regulated proteins provides a diverse toolbox for synthetic circuit regulation that enhances multi-input information processing-actuation of cellular responses. Our approach enables design of artificial circuits that can reprogram cellular function with potential benefits as research tools and for future in vivo therapeutics and biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "Magnetically-actuated microrobots have many potential applications in biological environments. Microrobots have many uses in cellular environments since they can be remotely actuated and precisely manipulated in biochemical fluids. Most cellular phenomena depend on biochemical signals. Therefore, various techniques have been developed for encapsulation and release of drugs, nutrients or other cargo using microrobots. However, localized targeting without payload leakage during transport is challenging. In this work, we present a light-controlled delivery system integrated with magnetic microrobots which overcomes this challenge. We synthesize a photolabile linker which releases a cell-to-cell signaling molecule when exposed to light. This system is integrated with magnetic micro-robots, which can be steered to target locations in the cell culture. We demonstrate that gene expression in engineered bacterial cells is successfully activated when the signaling molecule is cleaved. This proposed method can be used for wide-ranging applications in the fields of engineering, biology, and medicine, in which the ability to target and release molecules on-demand to a particular location is important.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of tissue integrity during development and homeostasis requires the precise coordination of several cell-based processes, including cell death. In animals, the majority of such cell death occurs by apoptosis, a process mediated by caspase proteases. To elucidate the role of caspases in tissue integrity, we investigated the behavior of Drosophila epithelial cells that are severely compromised for caspase activity. We show that these cells acquire migratory and invasive capacities, either within 1–2 days following irradiation or spontaneously during development. Importantly, low levels of effector caspase activity, which are far below the threshold required to induce apoptosis, can potently inhibit this process, as well as a distinct, developmental paradigm of primordial germ cell migration. These findings may have implications for radiation therapy in cancer treatment. Furthermore, given the presence of caspases throughout metazoa, our results could imply that preventing unwanted cell migration constitutes an ancient non-apoptotic function of these proteases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a majority of protein-coding genes, affecting nearly all biological pathways. However, the quantitative dimensions of miRNA-based regulation are not fully understood. In particular, the implications of miRNA target site location, composition rules for multiple target sites, and cooperativity limits for genes regulated by many miRNAs have not been quantitatively characterized. We explore these aspects of miRNA biology at a quantitative single-cell level using a library of 620 miRNA sensors and reporters that are regulated by many miRNA target sites at different positions. Interestingly, we find that miRNA target site sets within the same untranslated region exhibit combined miRNA activity described by an antagonistic relationship while those in separate untranslated regions show synergy. The resulting antagonistic/synergistic computational model enables the high-fidelity prediction of miRNA sensor activity for sensors containing many miRNA targets. These findings may help to accelerate the development of sophisticated sensors for clinical and research applications.",

    "abstract": "Significance\n            In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that biological morphogenesis could arise from a dynamical process in reaction systems with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. Turing’s conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, but recent stochastic extension of the theory predicts pattern formation without such strong conditions. We have forward-engineered bacterial populations with signaling molecules that form a stochastic activator–inhibitor system that does not satisfy the classic Turing conditions but exhibits disordered patterns with a defined length scale and spatial correlations that agree quantitatively with stochastic Turing theory. Our results suggest that Turing-type mechanisms, driven by gene expression or other source of stochasticity, may underlie a much broader range of patterns in nature than currently thought.\n          , \n            The origin of biological morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science, underlying our understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952, Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction–diffusion systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator–inhibitor birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with no severe requirement on the ratio of activator–inhibitor diffusion coefficients. To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules form a stochastic activator–inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity, can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.",

Intracellular proteins are involved in almost all cellular processes, and thus can provide important information about changes in cellular conditions such as infections, mutations, or disease states. Here we report the design of a modular platform for intrabody-based protein sensing-actuation devices with transcriptional output triggered by detection of intracellular proteins in mammalian cells. We demonstrate reporter activation response (fluorescence, apoptotic gene) to proteins involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and Huntington’s disease, and show sensor-based interference with HIV-1 downregulation of HLA-I in infected T cells. Our method provides a means to link varying cellular conditions with robust control of cellular behavior for scientific and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "N-linked glycosylation is a post-translational modification that affects potency, safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic clearance of several therapeutic proteins including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A robust control strategy is needed to accurately dial in appropriate glycosylation profile during the course of a cell culture process. However, N-glycosylation dynamics remain insufficiently understood due to the lack of integrative and quantitative analyses of factors that influence the dynamics, including nucleotide sugar donors (NSDs), glycosyltransferases and glycosidases. Here, an integrative approach is taken employing multiple omics analyses to dissect the temporal dynamics of glycoforms produced during fed-batch cultures of CHO cells. Several pathways linked with NSD metabolism, such as glycolysis, TCA cycle and purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis exhibit significant temporal dynamics over cell culture period. The steps involving galactose and sialic acid addition were determined as temporal bottlenecks in the N-glycosylation process. Our results show that galactose and not manganese is able to mitigate the temporal bottleneck, despite both being known effectors of galactosylation. Another bottleneck step, sialylation, is primarily governed by the sialyltransferases, but is also affected significantly by galactosylated precursors and the auto-regulation of CMP-sialic acid biosynthesis.",

Broader adoption of these therapies requires precise, context-specific control over cellular behavior. Gene circuits can be built to give sophisticated control over cellular behaviors so that therapeutic functions can, for example, be programmed to activate in response to disease biomarkers.\n            \n            \n              Science\n              , this issue p.\n              eaad1067\n            \n          , \n            \n              BACKGROUND\n              Gene and engineered-cell therapies promise new treatment modalities for incurable or difficult-to-treat diseases. First-generation gene and engineered-cell therapies are already used in the clinic, including an ex vivo gene-replacement therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies for certain types of leukemias and lymphomas, an adeno-associated virus gene therapy for inherited retinal diseases, and investigational therapies for β-thalassemia, sickle cell disease, hemophilia, and spinal muscular atrophy. Despite these early successes, safety concerns may hamper the broader adoption of some of these approaches: For example, overexpression of a therapeutic gene product with a narrow therapeutic window may be toxic, and excessive activation of T cells can be fatal. More-sophisticated control over cellular activity would allow us to reliably “program” cells with therapeutic behaviors, leading to safer and more effective gene and engineered-cell therapies as well as new treatments.\n            \n            \n              ADVANCES\n              Recent advances in synthetic biology are enabling new gene and engineered-cell therapies. These developments include engineered biological sensors that can detect disease biomarkers such as microRNAs and cell-surface proteins; genetic sensors that respond to exogenous small molecules; and new methods for interacting with various components of the cell—editing DNA, modulating RNA, and interfacing with endogenous signaling networks. These new biological modules have therapeutic potential on their own and can also serve as building blocks for sophisticated synthetic gene “circuits” that precisely control the strength, timing, and location of therapeutic function. This advanced control over cellular behavior will facilitate the development of treatments that address the underlying molecular causes of disease as well as provide viable therapeutic strategies in situations where the biomolecular targets have been previously considered “undruggable.”\n              Recent publications have demonstrated several strategies for designing complex therapeutic genetic programs by combining basic sensor, regulatory, and effector modules. These strategies include (i) external small-molecule regulation to control therapeutic activity postdelivery, (ii) sensors of cell-specific biomarkers that activate therapeutic activity only in diseased cells and tissues, and/or (iii) feedback control loops that maintain homeostasis of bodily systems. Example therapeutic systems include a genetic circuit that senses two specific cell-surface markers to activate CAR T cells only in the presence of target cancer cells, a circuit that programmatically differentiates pancreatic progenitor cells into insulin-secreting β-like cells, and a gene network that senses the amount of psoriasis-associated cytokines to release immune-modulatory proteins only during flare-ups. These proof-of-concept systems may lead to new treatments that are dramatically safer and more effective than current therapies.\n            \n            \n              OUTLOOK\n              Rapid progress in synthetic biology and related fields is bringing therapeutic gene circuits ever closer to the clinic. Ongoing efforts in modeling and simulating mammalian genetic circuits will reduce the number of circuit variants that need to be tested to achieve the desired behavior. The platforms used to test genetic circuits are also evolving to more closely resemble the actual human environment in which the circuits will operate. Human organoid, tissue-on-a-chip, and whole-blood models will enable higher-throughput circuit characterization and optimization in a more physiologically relevant setting. Progress in nucleic acid delivery will improve the safety and efficiency with which therapeutic nucleic acids are introduced to target cells, and new methods for immunomodulation will suppress or mitigate unwanted immune responses. Together, these advances will accelerate the development and adoption of synthetic biology-based gene and engineered-cell therapies.\n              \n                \n                  Programming gene and engineered-cell therapies with synthetic biology to improve human health.\n                  Genetically encoded therapeutic programs can regulate the dosage, localization, or timing of therapeutic function by sensing and processing externally administered signals as well as cell-specific and systemic disease biomarkers. These synthetic gene networks may lead to gene and engineered-cell therapies that are safer and more effective and that can address a broader class of diseases than current approaches.\n                \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Gene and engineered-cell therapies promise to treat diseases by genetically modifying cells to carry out therapeutic tasks. Although the field has had some success in treating monogenic disorders and hematological malignancies, current approaches are limited to overexpression of one or a few transgenes, constraining the diseases that can be treated with this approach and leading to potential concerns over safety and efficacy. Synthetic gene networks can regulate the dosage, timing, and localization of gene expression and therapeutic activity in response to small molecules and disease biomarkers. Such “programmable” gene and engineered-cell therapies will provide new interventions for incurable or difficult-to-treat diseases.",

While this diversity is one of the field’s primary strengths, it also makes it challenging for newcomers to acquire the background knowledge necessary to thrive. To address this gap, we developed a course that provides a structured approach to learning the biological principles and theoretical underpinnings of synthetic biology. Our course, Principles of Synthetic Biology (PoSB), was released on the massively open online course platform edX in 2016. PoSB seeks to teach synthetic biology through five key fundamentals: (i) parts and layers of abstraction, (ii) biomolecular modeling, (iii) digital logic abstraction, (iv) circuit design principles and (v) extended circuit modalities. In this article, we describe the five fundamentals, our formulation of the course, and impact and metrics data from two runs of the course through the edX platform.",

    "publisher": "Synthetic Biology",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n          Regulation of transgene expression is becoming an integral component of gene therapies, cell therapies and biomanufacturing. However, transcription factor-based regulation upon which the majority of such applications are based suffers from complications such as epigenetic silencing, which limits the longevity and reliability of these efforts. Genetically engineered mammalian cells used for cell therapies and biomanufacturing as well as newer RNA-based gene therapies would benefit from post-transcriptional methods of gene regulation, but few such platforms exist that enable sophisticated programming of cell behavior. Here we engineer the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions of transcripts to enable robust and composable RNA-level regulation through transcript cleavage and, in particular, create modular RNA-level OFF- and ON-switch motifs. We show that genomically introduced transgenes exhibit resistance to silencing when regulated using this platform compared to those that are transcriptionally-regulated. We adapt nine CRISPR-specific endoRNases as RNA-level “activators” and “repressors” and show that these can be easily layered and composed to reconstruct genetic programming topologies previously achieved with transcription factor-based regulation including cascades, all 16 two-input Boolean logic functions, positive feedback, a feed-forward loop and a putative bistable toggle switch. The orthogonal, modular and composable nature of this platform as well as the ease with which robust and predictable gene circuits are constructed holds promise for their application in gene and cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n            Biological research is relying on increasingly complex genetic systems and circuits to perform sophisticated operations in living cells. Performing these operations often requires simultaneous delivery of many genes, and optimizing the stoichiometry of these genes can yield drastic improvements in performance. However, sufficiently sampling the large design space of gene expression stoichiometries in mammalian cells using current methods is cumbersome, complex, or expensive. We present a ‘poly-transfection’ method as a simple yet high-throughput alternative that enables comprehensive evaluation of genetic systems in a single, readily-prepared transfection sample. Each cell in a poly-transfection represents an independent measurement at a distinct gene expression stoichiometry, fully leveraging the single-cell nature of transfection experiments. We first benchmark poly-transfection against co-transfection, showing that titration curves for commonly-used regulators agree between the two methods. We then use poly-transfections to efficiently generate new insights, for example in CRISPRa and synthetic miRNA systems. Finally, we use poly-transfection to rapidly engineer a difficult-to-optimize miRNA-based cell classifier for discriminating cancerous cells. One-pot evaluation enabled by poly-transfection accelerates and simplifies the design of genetic systems, providing a new high-information strategy for interrogating biology.",

    "abstract": "Self-replicating (replicon) RNA is a promising new platform for gene therapy, but applications are still limited by short persistence of expression in most cell types and low levels of transgene expression in vivo. To address these shortcomings, we developed an in vitro evolution strategy and identified six mutations in nonstructural proteins (nsPs) of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) replicon that promoted subgenome expression in cells. Two mutations in nsP2 and nsP3 enhanced transgene expression, while three mutations in nsP3 regulated this expression. Replicons containing the most effective mutation combinations showed enhanced duration and cargo gene expression in vivo. In comparison to wildtype replicon, mutants expressing IL-2 injected into murine B16F10 melanoma showed 5.5-fold increase in intratumoral IL-2 and 2.1-fold increase in infiltrating CD8 T cells, resulting in significantly slowed tumor growth. Thus, these mutant replicons may be useful for improving RNA therapeutics for vaccination, cancer immunotherapy, and gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Direct Mutual Inhibition is known to be the primary mechanism behind bi-stabile behavior in biological neuronal networks to implement a neuronal toggle switch, similar to flip-flops in electronics. With a view to enabling the implementation of this pervasive behavior in neuromorphic computing, we have previously used computational models to conclude that direct mutual inhibition suffers from a common mode failure, and have proposed an alternative design, staged mutual inhibition, that ensures correct switching. In this work, we provide further analysis for these two designs with respect to switching delay as a performance metric, similar to hold-time considerations in electronics. Our timing analysis shows that staged mutual inhibition incurs slightly larger delay compared with direct mutual inhibition, which is attributed to its more sophisticated design. We perform simulations to validate our quantitative delay analysis.",

    "abstract": "N-linked glycosylation in monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is crucial for structural and functional properties of mAb therapeutics, including stability, pharmacokinetics, safety and clinical efficacy. The biopharmaceutical industry currently lacks tools to precisely control N-glycosylation levels during mAb production. In this study, we engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells with synthetic genetic circuits to tune N-glycosylation of a stably expressed IgG. We knocked out two key glycosyltransferase genes, α-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) and β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GALT1), genomically integrated circuits expressing synthetic glycosyltransferase genes under constitutive or inducible promoters and generated antibodies with concurrently desired fucosylation (0–97%) and galactosylation (0–87%) levels. Simultaneous and independent control of FUT8 and β4GALT1 expression was achieved using orthogonal small molecule inducers. Effector function studies confirmed that glycosylation profile changes affected antibody binding to a cell surface receptor. Precise and rational modification of N-glycosylation will allow new recombinant protein therapeutics with tailored in vitro and in vivo effects for various biotechnological and biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "While much of synthetic biology was founded on the creation of reusable, standardized parts, there is now a growing interest in synthetic networks which can compute unique, specially-designed functions in order to recognize patterns or classify cells in-vivo. While artificial neural networks (ANNs) have long provided a mature mathematical framework to address this problem in-silico, their implementation becomes much more challenging in living systems. In this work, we propose a Biomolecular Neural Network (BNN), a dynamical chemical reaction network which faithfully implements ANN computations and which is unconditionally stable with respect to its parameters when composed into deeper networks. Our implementation emphasizes the usefulness of molecular sequestration for achieving negative weight values and a nonlinear \"activation function\" in its elemental unit, a biomolecular perceptron. We then discuss the application of BNNs to linear and nonlinear classification tasks, and draw analogies to other major concepts in modern machine learning research.",

    "abstract": "Mixtures of different types of living cells within cultured spheroids segregate in space, sometimes forming core-shell distributions. One long-standing potential mechanism behind this process is described by the differential adhesion hypotheses, which states that cells having differing levels of adhesivity will separate into groups. While this hypothesis has been tested in many ways, alternative driving forces have been proposed. To investigate an extreme limit of cell clustering and segregation, we perform studies using only one cell-type at a time, replacing all other cells with passive, non-adhesive microgel particles. Multiple cell types with tunable cadherin densities are dispersed in polyacrylamide microgels at different volume fractions and monitored over time. In this talk, we will present data on the kinetics of aggregation, the physical characteristics of clusters including fractal dimension, and the role of adhesion energy density on aggregates. By treating microgels as passive, non-adhesive ``surrogate'' cells, we envision testing theoretical models of active matter designed to study cell-cell phase separation, but in this case setting the appropriate parameters to zero.",

    "abstract": "Major Goals: The project consists of two phases. In Phase 1, the objective was to explore design approaches for genetically programming a single cell line to give rise to a multicellular system with a predetermined three-dimensional form. In Phase 2 was to design and build tunable control of three-dimensional form in a clonal cell population, with differentiated surfaces. Phase 1 objectives included modeling and simulation, circuit design and construction, experiments, and a demo of three-dimensional sizes and shapes that are stable for at least 1 week under optimal growth/differentiation. Phase 1 simulation objectives included development of theoretical models that bridge developmental biology and synthetic biology objectives to achieve programmed development of morphology in an expanding clonal cell population. Potential issues in design were identified (see discussion below) and simulations were adjusted based on experimental data. Phase 1 objectives also included circuit design, construction, and experiments for interior / exterior circuits and other morphology circuits. Phase 2 objectives included modeling and simulation, circuit design and construction, experiments, and a demonstration of programmed forms that are stable in size and shape over a minimum period of 1 week under optimal growth/differentiation conditions. Simulations and modeling objectives included creating of a shape compiler for fast and accurate modeling. Phase 2 theoretical modeling objects were to predict points and potential mechanisms of control of morphology development. Simulations were Adjusted based on experimental data to refine predictions, including new objectives for cell-sorting based shape and image analysis. Phase 2 circuit objectives included design, construction, and experiments of both shape selection and facet selection circuits.",

    "abstract": "Proteins can function as biomarkers of pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases, infections or metabolic syndromes. Engineering cells to sense and respond to these biomarkers may help the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying pathologies, as well as to develop new cell-based therapies. While several systems that detect extracellular proteins have been developed, a modular framework that can be easily re-engineered to sense different intracellular proteins was missing. Here, we describe a protocol to implement a modular genetic platform that senses intracellular proteins and activates a specific cellular response. The device operates on intracellular antibodies or small peptides to sense with high specificity the protein of interest, triggering the transcriptional activation of output genes, through a TEV protease (TEVp)-based actuation module. TEVp is a viral protease that selectively cleaves short cognate peptides and is widely used in biotechnology and synthetic biology for its high orthogonality to the cleavage site. Specifically, we engineered devices that recognize and respond to protein-biomarkers of viral infections and genetic diseases, including mutated huntingtin, NS3 serine-protease, Tat and Nef proteins to detect Huntington&#8217;s disease, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, respectively. Importantly, the system can be hand tailored for the desired input-output functional outcome, such as fluorescent readouts for biosensors, stimulation of antigen presentation for immune response, or initiation of apoptosis to eliminate unhealthy cells.",

    "abstract": "Cell state-specific promoters constitute essential tools for basic research and biotechnology because they activate gene expression only under certain biological conditions. Synthetic Promoters with Enhanced Cell-State Specificity (SPECS) can be superior to native ones, but the design of such promoters is challenging and frequently requires gene regulation or transcriptome knowledge that is not readily available. Here, to overcome this challenge, we use a next-generation sequencing approach combined with machine learning to screen a synthetic promoter library with 6107 designs for high-performance SPECS for potentially any cell state. We demonstrate the identification of multiple SPECS that exhibit distinct spatiotemporal activity during the programmed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), as well as SPECS for breast cancer and glioblastoma stem-like cells. We anticipate that this approach could be used to create SPECS for gene therapies that are activated in specific cell states, as well as to study natural transcriptional regulatory networks.",

However, even multi-agent therapies often fail to trigger all of the steps necessary for self-sustaining antitumor immunity. Here we describe self-replicating RNAs encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP), which combine three key elements: (1) an LNP composition that potently promotes ICD, (2) RNA that stimulates danger sensors in transfected cells and (3) RNA-encoded interleukin (IL)-12 for modulation of immune cells. Intratumoral administration of LNP-replicons led to high-level expression of IL-12, stimulation of a type I interferon response and cancer cell ICD, resulting in a highly inflamed tumor microenvironment and priming of systemic antitumor immunity. In several mouse models of cancer, a single intratumoral injection of LNP-replicons eradicated large established tumors, induced protective immune memory and enabled regression of distal uninjected tumors. LNP-replicons are thus a promising multifunctional single-agent immunotherapeutic.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology has the potential to bring forth advanced genetic devices for applications in healthcare and biotechnology. However, accurately predicting the behavior of engineered genetic devices remains difficult due to lack of modularity, wherein a device’s output does not depend only on its intended inputs but also on its context. One contributor to lack of modularity is loading of transcriptional and translational resources, which can induce coupling among otherwise independently-regulated genes. Here, we quantify the effects of resource loading in engineered mammalian genetic systems and develop an endoribonuclease-based feedforward controller that can adapt the expression level of a gene of interest to significant resource loading in mammalian cells. Near-perfect adaptation to resource loads is facilitated by high production and catalytic rates of the endoribonuclease. Our design is portable across cell lines and enables predictable tuning of controller function. Ultimately, our controller is a general-purpose device for predictable, robust, and context-independent control of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "In both natural and applied contexts, investigating cell self-assembly and aggregation within controlled 3D environments leads to improved understanding of how structured cell assemblies emerge, what determines their shapes and sizes, and whether their structural features are stable. However, the inherent limits of using solid scaffolding or liquid spheroid culture for this purpose restrict experimental freedom in studies of cell self-assembly. Here we investigate multi-cellular self-assembly using a 3D culture medium made from packed microgels as a bridge between the extremes of solid scaffolds and liquid culture. We find that cells dispersed at different volume fractions in this microgel-based 3D culture media aggregate into clusters of different sizes and shapes, forming large system-spanning networks at the highest cell densities. We find that the transitions between different states of assembly can be controlled by the level of cell–cell cohesion and by the yield stress of the packed microgel environment. Measurements of aggregate fractal dimension show that those with increased cell–cell cohesion are less sphere-like and more irregularly shaped, indicating that cell stickiness inhibits rearrangements in aggregates, in analogy to the assembly of colloids with strong cohesive bonds. Thus, the effective surface tension often expected to emerge from increased cell cohesion is suppressed in this type of cell self-assembly.",

    "abstract": "Learning dynamical systems properties from data provides important insights that help us understand such systems and mitigate undesired outcomes. In this work, we propose a framework for learning spatio-temporal (ST) properties as formal logic specifications from data. We introduce SVM-STL, an extension of Signal Signal Temporal Logic (STL), capable of specifying spatial and temporal properties of a wide range of dynamical systems that exhibit time-varying spatial patterns. Our framework utilizes machine learning techniques to learn SVM-STL specifications from system executions given by sequences of spatial patterns. We present methods to deal with both labeled and unlabeled data. In addition, given system requirements in the form of SVM-STL specifications, we provide an approach for parameter synthesis to find parameters that maximize the satisfaction of such specifications. Our learning framework and parameter synthesis approach are showcased in an example of a reaction-diffusion system.",

This technology generally relies on traditional three-dimensional culture techniques that exploit cell-autonomous self-organization responses of hPSCs with minimal control over the external inputs supplied to the system. The convergence of stem cell biology and bioengineering offers the possibility to provide these stimuli in a controlled fashion, resulting in the development of naturally inspired approaches to overcome major limitations of this nascent technology. Based on the current developments, we emphasize the achievements and ongoing challenges of bringing together hPSC organoid differentiation, bioengineering and ethics. This Review underlines the need for providing engineering solutions to gain control of self-organization and functionality of hPSC-derived organoids. We expect that this knowledge will guide the community to generate higher-grade hPSC-derived organoids for further applications in developmental biology, drug screening, disease modelling and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Many synthetic gene circuits are restricted to single-use applications or require iterative refinement for incorporation into complex systems. One example is the recombinase-based digitizer circuit, which has been used to improve weak or leaky biological signals. Here we present a workflow to quantitatively define digitizer performance and predict responses to different input signals. Using a combination of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and fold change (FC), we evaluate three small-molecule inducible digitizer designs demonstrating FC up to 508x and SNR up to 3.77 dB. To study their behavior further and improve modularity, we develop a mixed phenotypic/mechanistic model capable of predicting digitizer configurations that amplify a synNotch cell-to-cell communication signal (Δ SNR up to 2.8 dB). We hope the metrics and modeling approaches here will facilitate incorporation of these digitizers into other systems while providing an improved workflow for gene circuit characterization.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biological networks comprising fast, reversible reactions could enable engineering of new cellular behaviors that are not possible with slower regulation. Here, we created a bistable toggle switch in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a cross-repression topology comprising 11 protein-protein phosphorylation elements. The toggle is ultrasensitive, can be induced to switch states in seconds, and exhibits long-term bistability. Motivated by our toggle’s architecture and size, we developed a computational framework to search endogenous protein pathways for other large and similar bistable networks. Our framework helped us to identify and experimentally verify five formerly unreported endogenous networks that exhibit bistability. Building synthetic protein-protein networks will enable bioengineers to design fast sensing and processing systems, allow sophisticated regulation of cellular processes, and aid discovery of endogenous networks with particular functions.",

    "volume": "21",
    "abstract": "COVID-19 necessitates new approaches to artificial immunity for people at-risk, recently exposed, or in early stages of viral infection, for which there are limited treatment options. Rapid onset of lung inflammation caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the respiratory illness responsible for the coronavirus pandemic, can in principle be overcome with immunomodulatory gene therapy, but achieving this goal faces long-standing challenges. Further, there is a need for anti-viral therapies across other viral families such as H1N1 (flu), West Nile, Zika, Yellow Fever Virus, and emerging variants. To address these challenges, this project will create Viral First Responder Cells (VFRCs), a new type of sentinel/therapeutic cell. VFRCs are genetically engineered patient cells programmed to mount a first line defense against highly contagious viral diseases with long incubation periods, vector-borne diseases, and future viral diseases. Upon viral detection, VFRCs produce a cocktail of outputs to stop viral replication and activate an appropriately modulated immune response. The project's scientific output will focus on equitable distribution (e.g. genetically diverse target responses) and will broadly disseminate research-focused training material in novel media, including new grant-specific virtual lab training modules for remote and at-home learning. The project will provide inclusive viral therapy and COVID-related learning opportunities for underrepresented minority students, integrate with MIT's efforts to address systemic racism, and increase retention of women and minorities via an outreach portal. This project will create a new synthetic immune system to overcome limitations in traditional artificial immunity (e.g. immunization or antibody therapy) by genetically engineering patient cells (e.g. a small subset of lung epithelial cells) with broad-range and virus specific sensors of infection (VFRC sentinels). VFRCs rapidly detect viral entry using precise multi-input sensors that monitor for changes to cellular transcriptional signatures and genetic logic that responds by activating both pathways that lead to eradication of the virus, including appropriate activation of innate and adaptive host immune responses. Creating the capability to both sense immune state changes / viral entry and trigger powerful immunomodulatory responses in a controlled fashion will define a radically new approach for anti-viral therapies, define a new area of immunomodulatory biological design, and lead to new therapies for emergent viral threats. VFRC circuits limit side effects to cells already compromised by the virus and provide a more effective and tuned response based on the both the stage of infection and the degree of patient immunocompetence. An important element of VFRC safety is restricting intracellular response to occur only during active infection. When the virus is not present, genetic circuits introduced into the VFRCs remain in a vigilant but inactive \"monitor\" state. In this state, VFRCs monitor for signs of infection but do not alter the transcriptome. VFRCs also include a physician regulated genetic safety switch to deactivate any undesired response. Once proven safe and effective for one virus, this approach, which already includes broad viral entry sensors, can be customized for new viruses. This research will also answer fundamental scientific questions about viral immune responses and immunomodulatory therapy optimization. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory automation now commonly allows high-throughput sample preparation, culturing, and acquisition of microscopy images, but quantitative image analysis is often still a painstaking and subjective process. This is a problem especially significant for work on programmed morphogenesis, where the spatial organization of cells and cell types is of paramount importance. To address the challenges of quantitative analysis for such experiments, we have developed TASBE Image Analytics, a software pipeline for automatically segmenting collections of cells using the fluorescence channels of microscopy images. With TASBE Image Analytics, collections of cells can be grouped into spatially disjoint segments, the movement or development of these segments tracked over time, and rich statistical data output in a standardized format for analysis. Processing is readily configurable, rapid, and produces results that closely match hand annotation by humans for all but the smallest and dimmest segments. TASBE Image Analytics can thus provide the analysis necessary to complete the design-build-test-learn cycle for high-throughput experiments in programmed morphogenesis, as validated by our application of this pipeline to process experiments on shape formation with engineered CHO and HEK293 cells.",

    "abstract": "Learning dynamical systems properties from data provides valuable insights that help us understand such systems and mitigate undesired outcomes. We propose a framework for learning spatio-temporal (ST) properties as formal logic specifications from data. We introduce Support Vector Machine-Signal Temporal Logic (SVM-STL), an extension of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), capable of specifying spatial and temporal properties of a wide range of systems exhibiting time-varying spatial patterns. Our framework utilizes machine learning techniques to learn SVM-STL specifications from system executions given by sequences of spatial patterns. We present methods to deal with both labeled and unlabeled data. In addition, given system requirements in the form of SVM-STL specifications, we provide an approach for parameter synthesis to find parameters that maximize the satisfaction of such specifications. Our learning framework and parameter synthesis approach are showcased in an example of a reaction-diffusion system.",

    "abstract": "Remarkable progress in bioengineering over the past two decades has enabled the formulation of fundamental design principles for a variety of medical and non-medical applications. These advancements have laid the foundation for building multicellular engineered living systems (M-CELS) from biological parts, forming functional modules integrated into living machines. These cognizant design principles for living systems encompass novel genetic circuit manipulation, self-assembly, cell–cell/matrix communication, and artificial tissues/organs enabled through systems biology, bioinformatics, computational biology, genetic engineering, and microfluidics. Here, we introduce design principles and a blueprint for forward production of robust and standardized M-CELS, which may undergo variable reiterations through the classic design-build-test-debug cycle. This Review provides practical and theoretical frameworks to forward-design, control, and optimize novel M-CELS. Potential applications include biopharmaceuticals, bioreactor factories, biofuels, environmental bioremediation, cellular computing, biohybrid digital technology, and experimental investigations into mechanisms of multicellular organisms normally hidden inside the “black box” of living cells.",

Here we create a highly tunable, modular, versatile CRISPR-based synthetic transcription system for the programmable control of gene expression and cellular phenotypes in mammalian cells. Genetic circuits consisting of well-characterized libraries of guide RNAs, binding motifs of synthetic operators, transcriptional activators, and additional genetic regulatory elements express mammalian genes in a highly predictable and tunable manner. We demonstrate the programmable control of reporter genes episomally and chromosomally, with up to 25-fold more activity than seen with the EF1α promoter, in multiple cell types. We use these circuits to program the secretion of human monoclonal antibodies and to control T-cell effector function marked by interferon-γ production. Antibody titers and interferon-γ concentrations significantly correlate with synthetic promoter strengths, providing a platform for programming gene expression and cellular function in diverse applications.",

    "abstract": "Regulated transgene expression is an integral component of gene therapies, cell therapies and biomanufacturing. However, transcription factor-based regulation, upon which most applications are based, suffers from complications such as epigenetic silencing that limit expression longevity and reliability. Constitutive transgene transcription paired with post-transcriptional gene regulation could combat silencing, but few such RNA- or protein-level platforms exist. Here we develop an RNA-regulation platform we call “PERSIST\" which consists of nine CRISPR-specific endoRNases as RNA-level activators and repressors as well as modular OFF- and ON-switch regulatory motifs. We show that PERSIST-regulated transgenes exhibit strong OFF and ON responses, resist silencing for at least two months, and can be readily layered to construct cascades, logic functions, switches and other sophisticated circuit topologies.

    "abstract": "Engineered signaling networks can impart cells with new functionalities useful for directing differentiation and actuating cellular therapies. For such applications, the engineered networks must be tunable, precisely regulate target gene expression, and be robust to perturbations within the complex context of mammalian cells. Here, we use bacterial two-component signaling proteins to develop synthetic phosphoregulation devices that exhibit these properties in mammalian cells. First, we engineer a synthetic covalent modification cycle based on kinase and phosphatase proteins derived from the bifunctional histidine kinase EnvZ, enabling analog tuning of gene expression via its response regulator OmpR. By regulating phosphatase expression with endogenous miRNAs, we demonstrate cell-type specific signaling responses and a new strategy for accurate cell type classification. Finally, we implement a tunable negative feedback controller via a small molecule-stabilized phosphatase, reducing output expression variance and mitigating the context-dependent effects of off-target regulation and resource competition. Our work lays the foundation for establishing tunable, precise, and robust control over cell behavior with synthetic signaling networks.",

    "abstract": "Plant synthetic biology has significant technological potential, but the complexity of plant biology has made it difficult to engineer complex information-processing circuits into plants. The synthetic genetic toggle switch, which translates binary external stimuli into binary internal outcomes, was the earliest information-processing synthetic circuit developed in E. Coli in 2000. Here we report on results from a long collaborative effort to develop the first synthetic toggle switch in Arabidopsis. We used a forward engineering approach by first analyzing synthetically designed repressors in plant protoplasts[1]. Parameters obtained allowed us to predict the combinations most likely to work in the plant. We then chose two combinations to test, assembled and inserted them in Arabidopsis and used luciferase luminescence to report on circuit behavior. Assessing circuit behavior in plants was affected by unexpected phenomena such as tissue specific differences and the confounding effects of plant growth. Despite these issues we were able to successfully fit a mathematical model to the plant data using MCMC sampling. Analysis of the results led to the conclusion that one of the two combinations satisfied the tests for bistability. This circuit is, to our knowledge, the first synthetic genetic toggle switch in a plant[2].

    "abstract": "Biological organisms learn from interactions with their environment throughout their lifetime. For artificial systems to successfully act and adapt in the real world, it is desirable to similarly be able to learn on a continual basis. This challenge is known as lifelong learning, and remains to a large extent unsolved. In this Perspective article, we identify a set of key capabilities that artificial systems will need to achieve lifelong learning. We describe a number of biological mechanisms, both neuronal and non-neuronal, that help explain how organisms solve these challenges, and present examples of biologically inspired models and biologically plausible mechanisms that have been applied to artificial systems in the quest towards development of lifelong learning machines. We discuss opportunities to further our understanding and advance the state of the art in lifelong learning, aiming to bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence.",

Analogously to their revolutionary impact on computing, neuro-inspired models can transform synthetic gene circuit design in a manner that is reliable, efficient in resource utilization, and readily reconfigurable for different tasks. To this end, we introduce the perceptgene, a perceptron that computes in the logarithmic domain, which enables efficient implementation of artificial neural networks in Escherichia coli cells. We successfully modify perceptgene parameters to create devices that encode a minimum, maximum, and average of analog inputs. With these devices, we create multi-layer perceptgene circuits that compute a soft majority function, perform an analog-to-digital conversion, and implement a ternary switch. We also create a programmable perceptgene circuit whose computation can be modified from OR to AND logic using small molecule induction. Finally, we show that our approach enables circuit optimization via artificial intelligence algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Reprogramming human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is inefficient, with heterogeneity among transcription factor (TF) trajectories driving divergent cell states. Nevertheless, the impact of TF dynamics on reprogramming efficiency remains uncharted. We develop a system that accurately reports OCT4 protein levels in live cells and use it to reveal the trajectories of OCT4 in successful reprogramming. Our system comprises a synthetic genetic circuit that leverages noise to generate a wide range of OCT4 trajectories and a microRNA targeting endogenous OCT4 to set total cellular OCT4 protein levels. By fusing OCT4 to a fluorescent protein, we are able to track OCT4 trajectories with clonal resolution via live-cell imaging. We discover that a supraphysiological, stable OCT4 level is required, but not sufficient, for efficient iPSC colony formation. Our synthetic genetic circuit design and high-throughput live-imaging pipeline are generalizable for investigating TF dynamics for other cell fate programming applications.",

    "abstract": "Background\nGaucher disease (GD) is a rare lysosomal storage disease caused by pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1) resulting in a markedly decreased activity of the lysosomal enzyme b-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Enzyme replacement therapy is the gold standard for treating GD patients.\nAim\nHere, we investigate whether in silico molecular evolution can be combined with synthetic biology and gene therapy for the development of a new recombinant enzyme with higher activity.\nMaterials and methods\nWe developed novel GBA variants by introducing nonsynonymous mutations into the GBA gene obtained using in silico molecular evolution. These GBA variants are denoted as GBA-7, GBA-8, GBA-9 and GBA-12 and were cloned into lentiviral plasmids using synthetic biology approaches. Additionally, we obtained the wild-type GBA sequence from Homo sapiens, which is labeled GBA-Opt. In addition, we also aim to explore the differences in the transcriptional regulation using two different promoters: the CMV and the human elongation factor 1A (hEF1A). As a control, we generated a construct that expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under control of the same promoters. The characterization of these DNA constructs was performed using 293FT human cell line. We generated a total of 166 293FT cell lines with transient production of GBA (n = 100), GBA + GFP (n = 40), GFP (n = 8), and included virgin cells (n = 18). Out of the 100 GBA cell lines, 50 were utilized for real-time PCR analysis to investigate the transcription levels, while the remaining 50 were used to assess the enzyme-specific activity of GCase variants by fluorimetric assay. Furthermore, we determine mRNA secondary structures of GBA variants using the ViennaRNA and three-dimensional structures of the GCase-Opt and GCase-7 enzymes were elucidated using the AlphaFold2.\nResults and discussion\nQuantitative real time PCR revealed that for 4 GBA transcripts (GBA-opt, GBA-7, GBA-9 and GBA-12) under control of hEF1A promoter showed higher expression in 293FT cells compared with CMV promoter (p < 0.05). Among the GBA variants, we observed that 293FT_GBA-7 cells express 5.2-fold higher transcript levels compared with 293FT_GBA-opt cells (p < 0.05). In cells lines co-transfected with GFP and GBA, we observed that comparing normalized activity values while considering transfection efficiencies can provide a more accurate assessment of the enzyme catalytic properties. We also screened the cell lysates for GCase specific activity. We observed that 293FT_GBA-7 cells and 293FT_GBA-Opt cells produced 507.6 ± 38.16 and 426.6 ± 25.25 nmol substrate hydrolyzed/mg protein/h, respectively. For the other transgenic 293FT cell lines these values were lower. Also, for 293FT transfected with mock plasmid this value was 82.92 ± 5.83 nmol/mg/h, respectively (p = 0.014). The 3D structures of GCase-Opt and GCase-7 revealed a high degree of alignment with the Homo sapiens enzyme (UniProt P04062).\nConclusions\nThese findings demonstrate the promise of using in silico molecular evolution and synthetic biology approaches for developing enhanced enzyme variants for Gaucher disease, and suggest that GBA-7 could be a viable candidate for further investigation for replacement therapy in GD. Additional studies are warranted to investigate the biodistribution and long-term effects of GBA-7 in animal models.",

    "publisher": "bioRxiv",
    "abstract": "Reprogramming human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is inefficient, with heterogeneity among transcription factor (TF) trajectories driving divergent cell states. Nevertheless, the impact of TF dynamics on reprogramming efficiency remains uncharted. Here, we identify the successful reprogramming trajectories of the core pluripotency TF, OCT4, and design a genetic controller that enforces such trajectories with high precision. By combining a genetic circuit that generates a wide range of OCT4 trajectories with live-cell imaging, we track OCT4 trajectories with clonal resolution and find that a distinct constant OCT4 trajectory is required for colony formation. We then develop a synthetic genetic circuit that yields a tight OCT4 distribution around the identified trajectory and outperforms in terms of reprogramming efficiency other circuits that less accurately regulate OCT4. Our synthetic biology approach is generalizable for identifying and enforcing TF dynamics for cell fate programming applications.\nOne-sentence summary Genetic controllers and live-cell imaging offer a versatile strategy for probing the role of transcription factor dynamics in cell fate transitions.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genetic circuits have demonstrated the potential to sense and treat a wide range of disease states, but optimization of the levels of circuit components remains challenging and labor-intensive. To accelerate this process, our lab developed poly-transfection, a high-throughput extension of traditional mammalian transfection. In poly-transfection, each cell in the transfected population essentially performs a different experiment, testing the behavior of the circuit at different DNA copy numbers and allowing users to analyze a large number of stoichiometries in a single-pot reaction. So far, poly-transfections that optimize ratios of three-component circuits in a single well of cells have been demonstrated; in principle, the same method can be used for the development of even larger circuits. Poly-transfection results can be easily applied to find optimal ratios of DNA to co-transfect for transient circuits or to choose expression levels for circuit components for the generation of stable cell lines. Here, we demonstrate the use of poly-transfection to optimize a three-component circuit. The protocol begins with experimental design principles and explains how poly-transfection builds upon&#160;traditional co-transfection methods. Next, poly-transfection of cells is carried out and followed by flow cytometry a few days later. Finally, the data is analyzed by examining slices of the single-cell flow cytometry data that correspond to subsets of cells with certain component ratios. In the lab, poly-transfection has been used to optimize cell classifiers, feedback and feedforward controllers, bistable motifs, and many more. This simple but powerful method speeds up design cycles for complex genetic circuits in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a control framework for magnetically actuated cellbots, which combines Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Gaussian Processes (GPs) as a disturbance estimator for precise trajectory tracking. To address the challenges posed by unmodeled dynamics, we integrate data-driven modeling with model-based control to accurately track desired trajectories using relatively small data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate data-driven modeling with model-based control for the magnetic actuation of cellbots. The GP effectively learns and predicts unmodeled disturbances, providing uncertainty bounds as well. We validate our method through experiments with cellbots, demonstrating improved trajectory tracking accuracy.",

    "page": "2024.10.15.618477",
    "abstract": "The protein glycome of individual cell types in the brain is unexplored, despite the critical function of these modifications in development and disease. In aggregate, the most abundant asparagine (N-) linked glycans in the adult brain are high mannose structures, and specifically Man5GlcNAc2 (Man-5), which normally exits the ER for further processing in the Golgi. Mannose structures are uncommon in other organs and often overlooked or excluded in most studies. To understand cell-specific contributions to the unique brain N-glycome and its abundance of Man-5, we performed RNAseq and MALDI-MS TOF protein N-glycomics at several timepoints during differentiation of multiple cell types. To this end, homogeneous cultures of glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, and brain-specific endothelial cells were generated from monoclonal human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) through cellular reprogramming. Small molecule induction of stably integrated synthetic transcription units driving morphogen expression generated differentiated cells with distinct patterns mirroring intact tissue. Comparing uninduced hiPSCs for each cell type revealed identical transcriptomic and glycomic profiles before differentiation, with low quantities of Man-5. In differentiated glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, the most abundant N-glycans became Man-5 and its immediate precursor Man-6, despite the presence of transcripts encoding enzymes for their subsequent modification. Differentiation to brain-specific endothelial cells showed an opposite effect, with the N-glycome displaying an abundance of complex N-glycans and terminal modifications of the late secretory pathway. These results confirm that the restricted N-glycome profile of brain is programmed into neuronal differentiation, with regulation independent of the transcriptome and under tight evolutionary constraint.",

    "abstract": "Micron-scale robots (μbots) have recently shown great promise for emerging medical applications. Accurate control of μbots, while critical to their successful deployment, is challenging. In this work, we consider the problem of tracking a reference trajectory using a μbot in the presence of disturbances and uncertainty. The disturbances primarily come from Brownian motion and other environmental phenomena, while the uncertainty originates from errors in the model parameters. We model the μbot as an uncertain unicycle that is controlled by a global magnetic field. To compensate for disturbances and uncertainties, we develop a nonlinear mismatch controller. We define the model mismatch error as the difference between our model's predicted velocity and the actual velocity of the μbot. We employ a Gaussian Process to learn the model mismatch error as a function of the applied control input. Then we use a least-squares minimization to select a control action that minimizes the difference between the actual velocity of the μbot and a reference velocity. We demonstrate the online performance of our joint learning and control algorithm in simulation, where our approach accurately learns the model mismatch and improves tracking performance. We also validate our approach in an experiment and show that certain error metrics are reduced by up to 40%.",

    "abstract": "Gaucher Disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disease caused by pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase gene, leading to the loss of β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzymatic activity. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant GCase is the standard of care in GD patients. Our study investigates the combined use of in silico molecular evolution, synthetic biology and gene therapy approaches to develop a new synthetic recombinant enzyme. We engineered four GCases containing missense mutations in the signal peptide (SP) from four selected mammalian species, and compared them with human GCase without missense mutations in the SP. We investigated transcriptional regulation with CMV and hEF1a promoters alongside a GFP control construct in 293-FT human cells. One hEF1a-driven mutant GCase shows a 5.2-fold higher level of transcription than control GCase. In addition, this mutant exhibits up to a sixfold higher activity compared with the mock-control, and the predicted tertiary structure of this mutant GCase aligns with human GCase. We also evaluated conserved and coevolved residues mapped to functionally important positions. Further studies are needed to assess its functionality in a GD animal model. Altogether, our findings provide in vitro evidence of the potential of this engineered enzyme for improved therapeutic effects for GD.",

    "publisher": "bioRxiv",
    "abstract": "The field of microrobotics has immensely grown in the last few decades, exhibiting several challenges as new features such as shapes, sizes, and actuation mechanisms are explored. Two of the biggest challenges faced in microrobotics are the development of a control system suited for precise microrobotic manipulation, and the ability to navigate microrobots in densely populated environments. In this paper, we fabricate the Mazebot microrobots using silica spheres and ferromagnetic coating, and we use them to create cellbots with genetically modified Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Subsequently, we navigate both the Mazebots and the cellbots through a dense environment populated by CHO cells. The Mazebots navigation is done with a control system that allows the Mazebots to swim on their own, or guide a specific cell from a given origin to a target location while avoiding cell obstacles. The control system operates in open and closed-loop modes, where the first one allows the microrobot to reorient the cell using self-induced fluid vortices, and the second one closely follows a predefined trajectory along the origin and destination. On the other hand, the cellbots navigation is done in closed-loop operation. This enables cell manipulation for potential applications in cell and tissue engineering when in a confined space. Biocompatibility of the Mazebots is confirmed through the exposure of CHO cells to the robots for 24 hours. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality of our algorithm and its potential for biomedical applications, showcasing our system as a powerful and efficient solution for precise cellular manipulation.",

    "abstract": "The brain is the most prominent biological computer. As a result, efforts to develop biocomputing systems have focused on using neurons as their basic building block. That approach misses the fact that every organ in the body continuously senses and responds to a variety of inputs. These inputs can be a combination of electrical, chemical, mechanical or optical. These organs make decisions (i.e. compute responses) based on those inputs. With that in mind, the project team will attempt to develop intelligent organ-like masses of cells (organoids) based on liver cells. The hope is that understanding how to develop functional intelligence in this system will make it possible to do so using any type of cells. The notion of creating intelligent biological systems gives rise to many ethical questions. Questions related to whether such systems could evolve a form of consciousness will be addressed. Focused participation in an annual Science Olympiad for middle school students will be a primary effort to broaden the participation of students in hands-on science and engineering. It is expected that this will lead to greater involvement of those students in STEM careers at all levels. PROGENIC enables an intelligent liver organoid to learn and adapt to environmental conditions like viral infections and toxins. Engineered cells in the organoid are equipped with genetically encoded artificial neuronal networks that operate using DNA, RNA, and proteins. These cells are designed to learn new functions by modifying the genetically-encoded weights within their artificial neural networks. This is implemented using on-demand DNA modifications to genetic circuits in the chromosomes of living cells and is induced by communication from designer guide cells carried to various locations in the 3D organoids by magnetically controlled microrobots. Assessment of these new neuronal networks is performed by exposing the organoids to variable environmental conditions and perturbations, including infections and toxins. After these perturbations/insults, intelligence is evaluated by quantifying organoid function (e.g. albumin and urea secretion). The project is structured into three aims. Aim 1 engineers liver cells to harbor multi-node artificial neuronal networks within each cell, using synthetic gene circuits that operate with DNA, RNA, and proteins. Aim 2 utilizes microscale robots to facilitate communication with cells in organoids that change neural circuit weights and enable learning. Aim 3 creates an intelligent liver organoid that modifies organoid structure and function and evaluates the performance of the biocomputing system. In addition, neuroethical issues, such as the possibility of consciousness and sentience arising in the de novo neuronal network, are also explored. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

    "abstract": "Precisely sensing and guiding cell-state transitions via the conditional genetic activation of appropriate differentiation factors is challenging. Here we show that desired cell-state transitions can be guided via genetically encoded sensors, whereby endogenous cell-state-specific miRNAs regulate the translation of a constitutively transcribed endoribonuclease, which, in turn, controls the translation of a gene of interest. We used this approach to monitor several cell-state transitions, to enrich specific cell types and to automatically guide the multistep differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells towards a haematopoietic lineage via endothelial cells as an intermediate state. Such conditional activation of gene expression is durable and resistant to epigenetic silencing and could facilitate the monitoring of cell-state transitions in physiological and pathological conditions and eventually the ‘rewiring’ of cell-state transitions for applications in organoid-based disease modelling, cellular therapies and regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Pulse generator circuits based on incoherent feed-forward logic have been developed in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian systems but are typically limited to production of short pulses lasting less than 1 day. To generate longer-lasting pulses, we introduce a feedback-based topology that induces multiday pulsatile gene expression with tunable duration and amplitude in mammalian cells. We constructed the circuit using the PERSIST platform, which consists of entirely post-transcriptional logic, because our experience suggests that this approach may attenuate long-term epigenetic silencing. To enable external regulation of PERSIST regulatory elements, we engineered inducer-stabilized CRISPR endoRNases that respond to FDA-approved drugs, generating small molecule responses with greater than 20-fold change. These inducer-responsive proteins were connected to a two-state cross-repression positive feedback topology to generate the pulse generator circuit architecture. We then optimized circuit design through chromosomal integration of circuit components at varying stoichiometries, resulting in a small library of circuits displaying tunable pulses lasting between two and 6 days in response to a single 24 h input of inducer. We expect that the small molecule-stabilized PERSIST proteins developed will serve as valuable components in the toolbox for post-transcriptional gene circuit development and that tunable post-transcriptional pulse generator circuits in mammalian cells will enable study of endogenous hysteretic gene networks and support advances in cell therapies and organoid engineering.",

    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) remains the standard of care for non-neuropathic GD patients, its high cost significantly limits accessibility. To enhance production efficiency, we developed a lentiviral system encoding a codon-optimized GCase gene driven by the human elongation factor 1a (hEF1α) promoter for stable production in human cell lines. A functional lentiviral vector, LV_EF1α_GBA_Opt, was generated at a titer of 7.88 × 108 LV particles/mL as determined by qPCR. Six transduction cycles were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 30–50. The transduced heterogeneous human cell population showed GCase-specific activity of 307.5 ± 53.49 nmol/mg protein/h, which represents a 3.21-fold increase compared to wild-type 293FT cells (95.58 ± 16.5 nmol/mg protein/h). Following single-cell cloning, two clones showed specific activity of 763.8 ± 135.1 and 752.0 ± 152.1 nmol/mg/h (clones 15 and 16, respectively). These results show that codon optimization, a lentiviral delivery system, and clonal selection together enable the establishment of stable human cell lines capable of producing high levels of biologically active, synthetic recombinant GCase in vitro. Further studies are warranted for the functional validation in GD patient-derived fibroblasts and animal models.",

    "publisher": "bioRxiv",
    "abstract": "Precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression and cellular differentiation is essential for engineering native-like multicellular structures. Current cell differentiation approaches typically rely on externally provided inputs whose effects are not targeted to distinct cells in the appropriate state and hence cannot spatially organize and mature tissue structures as needed. Our work introduces a magnetically controlled microrobot (MR) platform for guiding mammalian cells to desired locations that, combined with synthetic biology, delivers biological signals at precise locations and times, enabling spatiotemporal control of cell-fate decision-making. We use synNotch, a cell-cell contact-based biological signaling that induces relevant gene expression in receivers when the receiver cells contact sender cells through ligand-receptor binding. Magnetically driven MRs are then allowed to be internalized by sender cells, resulting in magnetized sender cellbots. Using a 3-pair orthogonal Helmholtz coil system, we guided magnetized sender cellbots to precise locations in a receiver cell culture, activating desired fluorescent protein expression in target Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) receiver cells. Next, we engineered Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC) to function as receivers that can be instructed by senders to differentiate into endothelial cells (ECs) via overexpression of ETV2 (ETS variant transcription factor 2), a master transcriptional regulator of endothelial cell development. Using our magnetic platform, we guided multiple sender cellbots to target locations on a monolayer of hiPSC receivers, resulting in differentiation of receivers into ECs and possible onset of vascular formation. Our approach provides a foundation for the engineering spatial patterns by activating conditional triggers based on MR location and cell state at multiple time points, enabling several applications such as control of organoid architecture.",

However, their limited tissue repair capability has posed a challenge in achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes. Herein, we conceive a series of lipid nanoparticles to reprogram ASCs with durable protein secretion capacity for enhanced tissue engineering and regeneration. In vitro studies identify that the isomannide-derived lipid nanoparticles (DIM1T LNP) efficiently deliver RNAs to ASCs. Co-delivery of self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) and E3 mRNA complex (the combination of saRNA and E3 mRNA is named SEC) using DIM1T LNP modulates host immune responses against saRNAs and facilitates the durable production of proteins of interest in ASCs. The DIM1T LNP-SEC engineered ASCs (DS-ASCs) prolong expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), which show superior wound healing efficacy over their wild-type and DIM1T LNP-mRNA counterparts in the diabetic cutaneous wound model. Overall, this work suggests LNPs as an effective platform to engineer ASCs with enhanced protein generation ability, expediting the development of ASCs-based cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology aims to modify cellular behaviors by implementing genetic circuits that respond to changes in cell state. Integrating genetic biosensors into endogenous gene coding sequences using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and Cas9 enables interrogation of gene expression dynamics in the appropriate chromosomal context. However, embedding a biosensor into a gene coding sequence may unpredictably alter endogenous gene regulation. To address this challenge, we developed an approach to integrate genetic biosensors into endogenous genes without modifying their coding sequence by inserting into their terminator region single-guide RNAs that activate downstream circuits. Sensor dosage responses can be fine-tuned and predicted through a mathematical model. We engineered a cell stress sensor and actuator in CHO-K1 cells that conditionally activates antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 through a downstream circuit, thereby increasing cell survival under stress conditions. Our gene sensor and actuator platform has potential use for a wide range of applications that include biomanufacturing, cell fate control and cell-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "In synthetic biology, genetic components are assembled to make transcriptional units, and transcriptional units are assembled into circuits to perform specific and predictable functions of a genetic device. Genetic devices have been described in bacteria, mammalian cell cultures, and small organoids, yet the development of programmable genetic circuits for devices in plants has lagged. Programmable genetic devices require defining the component’s quantitative functions. Because plants have long life spans, studies often use transient analysis to define quantitative functions, while verification in stably engineered plants is often neglected and largely unknown. This raises the question if unique attributes of plants, such as environmental sensitivity, developmental plasticity, or alternation of generations, adversely impact predictability of plant genetic circuits and devices. Alternatively, it is also possible that genetic elements to produce predictable genetic devices for plants require rigorous characterization with detailed mathematical modeling. Here, we use plant genetic elements with quantitatively characterized transfer functions and developed in silico models to guide their assembly into a genetic device: a toggle switch or a mutually inhibitory gene-regulatory device. Our approach allows for computational selection of plant genetic components and iterative refinement of the circuit if the desired genetic functions are not initially achieved. We show that our computationally selected genetic circuit functions as predicted in stably engineered plants, including through tissue and organ differentiation. Developing abilities to produce predictable and programmable plant genetic devices opens the prospect of predictably engineering plant’s unique abilities in sustainable human and environmental systems.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL, enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and autonomous transportation of micro-objects and biological cells can enable significant advances in a wide variety of research disciplines. Here, we present a novel, vision-based, model-free microrobotic pushing algorithm for the autonomous manipulation of micro objects and biological cells. The algorithm adjusts the axis of a rotating magnetic field that in turn controls the heading angle and spin axis of a spherical Janus rolling microrobot. We introduce the concept of a microrobotic guiding corridor to constrain the object and to avoid pushing failures. We then show that employing only two simple conditions, the microrobot is able to successfully and autonomously push microscale objects along predefined trajectories. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by measuring the mean absolute error and completion time relative to a desired path at different actuation frequencies and guiding corridor widths. Finally, we demonstrate biomedical applicability by autonomously transporting a single biological cell, highlighting the methods potential for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA vaccines have demonstrated protective capability in combating SARS-CoV-2. Their extensive deployment across the global population leads to the broad presence of T-cell immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, presenting an opportunity to harness this immunological response as a universal antigen target for cancer treatment. Herein, we design and synthesize a series of amino alcohol- or amino acid-derived ionizable lipids (AA lipids) and develop an LNP-RNA-based antigen presentation platform to redirect spike-specific T-cell immunity against cancer in mouse models. First, in a prime-boost regimen, AA2 LNP encapsulating spike mRNA elicit stronger T-cell immunity against the spike epitopes compared to FDA-approved LNPs (ALC-0315 and SM-102), highlighting the superior delivery efficiency of AA2 LNP. Next, AA15V LNP efficiently delivers self-amplifying RNAs (saRNAs) encoding spike epitope-loaded single-chain trimer (sSE-SCT) MHC I molecules into tumor tissues, thereby inducing the presentation of spike epitopes. Our results show that a single intratumoral (i.t.) treatment of AA15V LNP-sSE-SCTs suppresses tumor growth and extends the survival of B16F10 melanoma and A20 lymphoma tumor-bearing mice vaccinated with AA2 LNP-spike mRNA. Additionally, AA15V LNP-sSE-SCTs enable SE-SCT expression in ex vivo human glioblastoma and lung cancer samples, suggesting its potential in clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Cells store information by means of chromatin modifications that persist through cell divisions and can hold gene expression silenced over generations. However, how these modifications may maintain other gene expression states has remained unclear. This study shows that chromatin modifications can maintain a wide range of gene expression levels over time, thus uncovering analog epigenetic memory. By engineering a genomic reporter and epigenetic effectors, we tracked the gene expression dynamics following targeted perturbations to the chromatin state. We found that distinct grades of DNA methylation led to corresponding, persistent gene expression levels. Altering the DNA methylation grade, in turn, resulted in permanent loss of gene expression memory. Consistent with experiments, our chromatin modification model indicates that analog memory arises when the positive feedback between DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications is lacking. This discovery will lead to a deeper understanding of epigenetic memory and to new tools for synthetic biology.",

    "title": "ETV2 mediated differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells results in functional endothelial cells for engineering advanced vascularized microphysiological models",
    "publisher": "bioRxiv",
    "abstract": "Patient-specific microphysiological models, exemplified by organs-on-a-chip and organoids, have become a valuable tool for broad applications, revolutionizing biomedical research. However, limitations persist, with functional vasculature being a significant challenge. Generating functional human induced pluripotent stem cell (h-iPSC) derived endothelial cells (h-iECs) represent an urgent need. With the discovery of ETV2’s determinant role in specifying EC lineages during differentiation, researchers have adopted techniques involving ETV2 overexpression to produce h-iECs more efficiently and consistently. However, the capacity of these cells to form functional vasculatures has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we generated multiple h-iPSC lines with inducible ETV2 expression, and subsequently differentiated them into h-iECs, which were validated functionally and by key endothelial markers and RNA-seq analysis. These cells are capable of self-organizing into stable microvascular networks (MVNs) in a microfluidic chip reproducibly, forming lumenized and functional vessels that mimic the in vivo capillary bed in both morphology and function – a result not achieved using h-iECs differentiated with conventional two-step methods using the same h-iPSC lines. Furthermore, complex microphysiological models featuring perfusable vasculature were also successfully developed using ETV2 activated h-iECs, demonstrated with vascularized tumor and blood-brain barrier (BBB) models. Additionally, by pooling genetically engineered h-iPSCs with inducible ETV2, we effectively employed an orthogonally induced differentiation approach to enhance vascularization of an organoid model. Our methodology opens avenues in precision medicine, leading to personalized microphysiological models with perfusable vasculature for various applications.",
